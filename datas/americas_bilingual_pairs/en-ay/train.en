April 23 is UNESCO's International Book Day  and just because the Global Voices team loves blogs, doesn't mean we've forgotten about other forms of the written word!
Moreover, because we believe that reading literature is a very enjoyable way to learn about another culture, we have a fun challenge for all Global Voices contributors and readers, and bloggers everywhere.
The Global Voices Book Challenge is as follows:
1) Read a book during the next month from a country whose literature you've never read before.
2) Write a blog post about him during the week of April 23.
If you would like to know what you should read about Vietnam, Bolivia, Mozambique or New Zealand, or any other country, simply ask in the comments section below!
Surely someone will give you some suggestions.
And if you have any recommendations about any work from your own country that should be read, please leave a comment too.
Once you've read your book (and written a post!) let us know  we'd love to find out what you've learned on your literary expedition.
Feel free to use the images above and below to spread the Global Voices Book Challenge!
China: Marching to protect East Lake in Wuhan
The East Lake, located in the city of Wuhan is a tourist and ecological area, covering an area of 82 square kilometers and is six times larger than the West Lake.
As it is a national 4A tourist area, its planning must be subject to environmental assessment and public consultation.
However, in May 2009 a real estate developer, Overseas Chinese Town, OCT (ing) signed an agreement on the development of this lake with the Wuhan city government, without mediating public consultation.
In December 2009 the real estate developer OCT won the contract to develop a large area of land (3167 mu, 1 mu = 666.67 square meters) occupying 1000 mu of the lake surface. (background via donghu)
The photo shows the natural beauty of East Lake:
In March 2010, the local media exposed the construction plan and in April of the same year the OCT claimed that the development project does not affect the East Lake.
However blogger Yaohaiying pointed out (chi) that the so-called artificial fish pond (450 mu) is located in the central part of the picturesque area and is clearly defined in the article on the protection of the East Lake approved by the State Minister.
Douban posted the advisor's note (chi):
Japan: People live longer, so does TV
Japan may be known for the longevity of its people, but television shows have a rich and long history as its population.
There are some shows that have been on the air for over half a century.
What's interesting is the variety: everything from talk shows, news and sports to cooking shows, music, anime and even a show about the Imperial Family.
This article takes a look at the Japanese Choju Bangumi (長寿番組), which literally means long life program. Definitions for Choju programs range from those aged 10 to those aged 50.
Oricon, who published a popularity ranking based on a survey, defines Choju shows as shows that have been on the air for more than 10 years.
A 30-year-old interviewee from Saitama Prefecture describes it as  one of the few programs with old music.
As another respondent from Nagano Prefecture, almost the same age, answered:  the tension that is unique to live streaming and events is great.
Fuji TV's Sazaesan , considered an iconic anime show, came in second.
The fourth one was for Nippon TV's Shoten.
The first broadcast of the anime Sazaesan was on October 5, 1969.
It's a long-running show that's turned 41 this year.
At a time when 20 percent of prime time drama ratings have become scarce, Sazaesan  averages a solid 20 percent.
This is extremely high for an anime show and has consolidated the show as a national icon.
Probably, the characters are recognized by 100% of the audience.
It would be NBC's Meet the Press, the Sunday morning political show that started in 1947.
Next up is CBS Evening News  and NBC's morning news show  Today .
The fourth is the CBS daytime drama Guiding Light.
What stands out from the list of Japanese Choju programs is the predominance of NHK (Japan Broadcasting Association), especially if you look at programs with more than half a century of history.
A wide range of genres are represented here, including the singing competition Nodojiman  (which can be said to resemble American Idol) and Kohaku Uta Gassen (an annual music program), and limited to news programs as in the US list.
PBS, which could be considered the American equivalent of some public broadcaster pioneering the industry in their respective countries, barely makes the top 10.
After watching an episode of Sazae-san, blogger Zakiyama Yumeko explained her argument and reflected: I wonder if the atmosphere of feeling good is the secret of Choju shows?
Do you like watching the same programs that your parents and grandparents enjoyed, or are they old-fashioned and boring?
Latin America: Festival of Free Software Installation 2010
Throughout Latin America, free software is important to many countries and individuals, who have decided to use these resources in public administration, as well as to find solutions to other challenges.
For example, in Cuba, the free software movement helped with sustainable development.The Ecuadorian government proposed public policies that include the use of free software, as did another regional leader in free software and culture, Brazil.
On April 24, 2010, many promoters and users of free software in Latin America celebrated with a party called FLISOL2010.

Watching the World Cup together: Uruguay vs France
The World Cup, which is arguably the world's largest sporting event, is being held for the first time on the African continent.
Global Voices has highlighted the many voices of citizens speaking out about the event and its social impact around the world.
In an effort to expand this conversation, we thought we could try to have a real-time chat while the games are going on.
So we will start with the Uruguay-Fancia meeting which will be held on the opening day of the tournament, on 11 June at 20:30 in South Africa.
You can click on the FIFA match list to see your local time.
France and Uruguay have been known rivals since Uruguay helped eliminate France, the reigning champion at the time of the 2002 World Cup.
We invite you to join the broadcast and discussion of this event in which we will be live a few minutes before the start of the game (20:30 local time).
We will have participants from Uruguay and France, as well as many African nations, including South Africa.
Different Global Voices bloggers and translators will watch the tournament live.
The conversation will also be enabled on Global Voices in French.
Watching the World Cup Together
South Africa: Debate on vuvuzelas at the World Cup
Perhaps the defining highlights of the 2010 World Cup to date have been the glittering new stadiums or the colorful costumes worn by fans from each of the 32 nations competing.
But without a doubt, the defining sound of the tournament has been the muffled sound of the vuvuzela, which can be heard by spectators attending the games or by television viewers.
The remarkable sound has sparked a debate over whether the vuvuzela adds or takes away experience from the World Cup.
However, for international visitors and spectators, the sound of the plastic instrument has been a novelty.
Photo of the vuvuzela in Soccer City by Alvez and used under a Creative Commons license.
This debate goes back to the 2009 Confederations Cup held in South Africa, which may have been the first contact with sound for many world football fans.
Some called for the vuvuzela to be banned from the stadium, saying it was taking away from the enjoyment of the game.
He said, "we shouldn't try to Europeanise the African World Cup".
Now, with just a few days left in the tournament, it has become an internet topic for those complaining about it, as well as those defending the instrument and even those criticizing complaints about the vuvuzela.
Although there are some reports that FIFA may consider restricting the vuvuzela due to complaints on television, many believe it will go ahead.
The criticism about the vuvuzela's buzz proved quite amusing to some, who turned it around to alleviate their complaints.
Daniel Reeders (@onekind) said: The West discovers Africa, discovers it is noisy, discordant, overwhelming and retires to Twitter to complain about the #vuvuzela
Finally, Karabo Harry (@kayrabH) puts everything in perspective, offering a suggestion:
If the sound of the #Vuvuzela irritates you look for #EarPlugs and complain about important things like #Analphabetism and #Poverty
Bolivia: The cost of Internet domains
Compared to many of its regional neighbors, where Chileans can purchase a .cl domain for US$40 for 2 years and where Argentines can even purchase a .com.ar domain for free, the price in Bolivia is out of reach for many local residents.
Recently, the Bolivian Network Information Center (NIC) announced that they reduced the price of a ".bo" domain name by 35%.

Niger: The Silent Hunger
The food crisis in the Sahel, which is hardly being reported, is reaching alarming proportions as about 2.5 million people in Niger are currently affected by food shortages.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has decided to step up emergency operations to protect the population at risk.After the food crisis in 2005, bloggers in Niger reflect on a new crisis, which this year is the result of the lack of rain last year.

Bolivian Voices: Jaqi Aru, spreading the Aymara language on the internet
Aymara is a native language of the Americas and one of the official languages of Peru and Bolivia.
There are approximately two million Aymara speakers in Bolivia and almost three million in total in South America.Rising Voices Voices Bolivian Voices project members noticed that there is little material available on the internet in their native Aymara language.
Ruben Hilari, with some local volunteers from El Alto, Bolivia, established the Jaqi Aru virtual community.
The goal of the Jaqi Aru website is to highlight and disseminate the Aymara language on the internet, through the creation of digital media content, which consists of translation, multimedia and social media tools.
Aymara has been losing speakers, both to Spanish and Quechua in the last century and many of the Aymara speakers now speak Quechua, another South American native language.

Argentina: Former President Néstor Kirchner has died
This Wednesday, in the early hours of the morning, Nestor Kirchner, former president and husband of the current president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, passed away.
The death, due to a heart attack, occurred in the Patagonian town of Calafate, where he resided in recent years.
Kirchner's sudden death prompted many people to gather in the city center during the day, even though it was a public holiday for the census.
His remains are expected to be laid to rest in the Casa Rosada, the traditional workplace of the presidents.
I'm not sure.

Call for participation open
And you, yes YOU, are part of this change.
In fact, as a digital native - someone for whom digital technologies are fundamental to life, you are directly affecting the lives of many, sometimes even without knowing it.
The Center for Internet and Society and Hives in collaboration with Rising Voices is calling on young technology users in Latin America and the Caribbean to join a global conversation.
The 3-day workshop, entitled "From Face to Interface", will focus on how young people use new platforms, media and spaces for communication and expression in the digital age.
If you've used digital technologies to make your voice heard, to express your opinion creatively online or to create new knowledge, we want to hear from you.
We invite you to share your perspectives, in an informal conversation with like-minded people from neighboring communities.
The workshop is open to candidates from Latin America and the Caribbean who are interested in an interactive and engaging dialogue that marks the beginning of the "Digital Natives with a Cause?" research in the region.
"From Face to Interface" is part of a more international research project, with the aim of producing an English language book, consolidating the knowledge of the Digital Natives of the Southern Hemisphere.
The workshop also aims to build a Knowledge Network in collaboration with the other participants and partners from the previous workshops in Taipei and Johannesburg.
This workshop will include organisers based in India and the Netherlands and participants who will also come from countries where Spanish is not the main language.
Therefore, a good knowledge of English is necessary.
Communication during the workshop will be in English, with Spanish translations available at certain times of the activity.

Egypt: January 25 protests in photos
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Egyptian protests.
One picture is worth a thousand tweets, especially when Twitter is blocked in Egypt in order to stop the circulation of information about the ongoing demonstrations in Egypt today (25).
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia decided to take her camera and go out into the streets to take some pictures and upload them to her Flickr account.
Here are some of their photographs: In Cairo, tens of thousands of security forces were seen in the streets early in the morning, wearing their famous black uniforms.
Photo taken by Zeinobia, licensed under creative commons.
The streets were empty.
Still the security forces had their own plans to control the mass of protesters, especially when the usual traffic jam was not there to naturally control the protesters.
Security forces blocked some of the main blocks and intersections in Cairo.
Cars were redirected to bridges or tunnels as much as possible, as it is harder to demonstrate in a tunnel, right!?
Some Twitter users reported that the subway was closed also to control the mass of protesters.

Egypt: A voice in the blackout, thanks to Google and Twitter
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Egyptian Protests.
Last night, in the wake of the total internet blackout in Egypt, Google and Twitter (along with SayNow, a company recently acquired by Google) made a timely announcement: they jointly launched SpeakToTweet, a service that would allow Egyptians to call an international number and record a voice message that would then be tweeted from the @speak2tweet account.
Throughout the night, recordings of Egyptians who heard about the service appeared on the Twitter account.
Due to the total ban on the internet, Egyptians probably found out through calls from their friends and family abroad.
@monasosh is one of these users; his brother @alaa reported that he had used the service.
So, I wanted everyone to know in case they don't get information tomorrow about what's going on, and I didn't want them to worry about us.
This time, I'm not afraid at all, as if I'm saying to you, 'Try it!'
Stay with us!
Most calls are made anonymously, without the caller identifying himself.
Another call from Egypt, available here, reads:
Tomorrow, it will be history.
Tomorrow, we will make history.
Tomorrow, Mubarak's regime will be over.
Tomorrow, we want you out of our country.
Long live Egypt.
Egyptians abroad have also taken advantage of the service to get their message heard by the world.
Stay strong, Egyptians, stay strong, we love you.
This is an Egyptian-American speaking for all the Egyptian-Americans who migrated here because of the brutal regime, stay strong: you are making us very proud.
I love you!
Anyone can make use of the service by calling one of the following international numbers and leaving a voice message: +16504194196 or +390662207294 or +97316199855.
The message will be automatically tweeted on @Speak2Tweet.

Two weeks later, on January 20, the Brazilian Ministry of Culture removed a Creative Commons license from its website.
The order to remove it was apparently given by the Dutch Minister and provoked all kinds of reactions on social media as well as among bloggers.

At the same time, on social media the world has seen the clashes in what we call society 2.0: Venezuelans have taken Twitter as their platform to discuss the situation and what are on the one hand the mistakes of 12 years of government, and on the other the achievements of the revolution - 2 ways of thinking in a divided country.

Sudan: South Sudan becomes the newest African country
South Sudan has officially become the newest country in Africa, after South Sudanese voted to secede from the North.
Official referendum figures released on Monday 7th showed that 98.83% of the southern voters chose to secede from the north.
Two sons of South Sudanese freedom fighter Gordon Muortat Mayen Mabor hold their photos as they wait to cast their ballots in the South Sudanese independence referendum in London, UK.

Pascal Ladu posts a podcast that captures the historic moment when the South Sudan Referendum Commission declared the preliminary official results of the referendum in Juba:
A large crowd of South Sudanese gathered at the Mausoleum of Dr. John Garang in Juba to celebrate the announcement of the preliminary official results of the referendum on Sunday.
The results showed almost unanimous support for secession throughout South Sudan.
The colorful occasion was celebrated with songs, dances, horn sounds, and drum beats.
The results, announced by the chairman of the South Sudanese Referendum Commission and his vice-chairman, were greeted with thunderous applause from the crowd.
As'ad questions the double standards of the US:
Compare the speed with which the US government recognized the state of South Sudan and the US government's treatment of Palestine.
Law Hawk says South Sudan will need to trust its northern neighbor:
Even so, Sudan is going to need to rely on its northern neighbor as the main oil pipeline from the southern oil fields must travel through Sudan to generate much of the revenue needed for the country to get going.
How will South Sudan attract investors?:
Maturity is rare...
Whatever you say, it should be referring to landmarks... not actions...!
Without reference points, any action can be called wonderful...!! as long as it is not compared...!!
I don't mean to question any official or representative, but Bell Syndrome tells us that only 2% (at any level) will be able to see the full picture...
You need to learn all the lessons, to pave your way without bright, false or distorted interests...
If you trust a knowledge-based Darfur expert...
This is not a recipe for FDI or point-to-point protocol (PPP), only UN/Government Assistant... Until you chart your own realistic visions on governance (what Singapore did), job creation (e.g. the Balkans), governance (e.g. South Africa); South Sudan is unlikely to attract investors...!
They're ambitious and cautious...
Kizzie is very jealous of the South Sudanese:
A good friend of mine said that the northerners are upset about the referendum in South Sudan because the southerners had the chance to vote and every southern vote makes a difference, we have nothing.
I registered to vote in the April election, but my chosen candidate withdrew from the race and I was left wondering if my vote would have made a difference to begin with.
Sudanese Optimist is happy for South Sudan, but...:
While I am very happy that South Sudan finally gained its independence from the patronizing enemies in the north, I am truly sad to see that we have lost such a vibrant part of our Sudanese culture.
Perhaps because of all the crazy politics around here lately, what amazes me most is the St. Francis prayer I read yesterday during the separation announcement.
Lodiong Morris reports that the North and South have resolved the issue of citizenship status:
According to the Minister, the semi-autonomous Government of South Sudan (GoSS) and the National Government agreed that southerners who wish to stay in the north can become northern citizens if they so wish.
Argentina: 26 years since the death of Julio Cortázar
Yesterday, February 12, 2011, was the 26th anniversary of the death of Argentine writer Julio Cortázar from leukemia.
Simon Kofoed writes about the author's life in argen-times.
Where did the 15,000 people registered here go?
They probably went to finish their groceries and hurry home.
In the end, they came to a text called the "Cancun Agreement", which has the advantage of receiving the approval of the majority of delegates (better than the previous episode in Copenhagen).
... the EXTREMELY positive nature of all the press releases I've read since yesterday.
For most of our English-speaking colleagues and those in the Climate Action Network (whose mechanism I now master), most of the communiqués were ready well before the end of the COP.
... whatever the final agreement in Cancun, the President ended his speech with a sentence: "We understand that we are not following our internal regulations, but to save face in Cancun, we are adopting the text".
Egypt: Kareem Amer is free
This post is part of our special coverage of the protests in Egypt in 2011.
Prominent Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer, also known as Abdulkareem Nabeel Sulaiman, has been released, Twitter users confirmed.
Kareem, who was meeting with independent filmmaker Samir Eshra, was 'kidnapped' by a group of thugs after leaving Tahrir Square on February 7, and then handed over to military security for violating the curfew imposed in Egypt since the January 25 protests began.After spending the day in a local prison, they were sent to a military prison "in the middle of the desert", where they spent the next few days watching other prisoners being victimized by the "submarine" (simulated drowning), beaten with sticks and electrocuted", according to an interview with the blogger in The Daily Beast.
Kareem, who had spent four years in prison for an article he posted on his blog, was released on November 15.
@daliaziada: Good news: blogger Kareem Amer has been released.
@weddady: I just got news that Kareem Amer has been released. #Jan25

Gaddafi: Kill all for all
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Libyan uprising.
Libya's dictator Muammar Al Gaddafi gave a speech on state television on Tuesday, in which he expressed his anger and warned and threatened anti-government protesters and all those who support them, saying Libya would end up in the same situation as countries like Afghanistan, Iraq or Somalia.
In his speech, he called on Libyan citizens to take to the streets tomorrow and go after the terrorists and hand them over to the security forces, so that they can be punished with death.
He also said he would continue to fight for Libya until the last drop of blood  and listed, in all kinds of detail, each and every action that would be punished with the death penalty, such as working for international organizations, using violence against government forces or threatening the security of the country.
This nonsensical and apparently improvised speech was followed by Libyan and Arab citizens as well as citizens around the world on Twitter.
Gaddafi's statement was both sarcastic and ridiculous, despite the country's unstable situation and the tragic circumstances in which the deaths occurred.
Gaddafi justified the brutal offensive of the last few days against the protesters, and also spoke of other events that happened in the past, when some governments had to kill protesters, and said things like Unity in China was more important than the lives of those in Tianamen Square.
He also said that tomorrow, young people (those who are not under the influence of drugs ) should form groups to defend the revolution he himself has started.
While waiting for him to deliver his speech, some Twitter users commented ironically on why he was taking so long to deliver his announced speech.
@acarvin: Gaddafi: young people have been taken away from their families and given hallucinogens.
Those who supplied them deserve punishment.
@rania_hafez: Gaddafi: Those who stand up to Libyan authorities and raise their arms against citizens of our country will be punished with death penalty under Libyan law

@ChangeInLibya: he is insulting the people who are supporting him , in the green square ...they are also showing photos of the green square from 20 days ago:)

@acarvin: Gaddafi: At the hospital, no one dared to change the name.

"We Are Not Ants": A book that promotes informed optimism
"Where ignorance is bliss, it is folly to be wise", wrote Thomas Gray in 1742.
In the age of social media and digital media, sometimes it seems that there is only bad news and there is nothing the average citizen can do about it.
Most of us know the old adage that ignorance is bliss, but is it possible that it's exactly the opposite, that ignorance breeds unhappiness?
The book We Are Not Ants came about in response to a widespread negativity and a sense of disempowerment.
But it is not a simple, mass, carefree self-help book.
The four young Spanish authors, who combine knowledge of economics, journalism, international development, entrepreneurship, marketing and design, presented the project as
If we were ants, humans would be a happy species.
We've colonized the entire planet, our life expectancy is increasing and our technological achievements are impressive.
However, we realize the magnitude of the challenges we still have to face and the dangers and injustices that still haunt us.
We are a community and what we do we do together, we share a common origin and, along with planet Earth, we also share a common future.
A future we decide.
The book is divided into three chapters:
Chapter one.
The world is fine.
Humans have made incredible progress in so many areas in the last few decades: we live longer, we are able to feed more, we are able to educate more, we have eradicated many diseases that were once deadly, and we are more supportive.
Chapter three.
Many will say that this is not enough and that humans have not been able to solve the major social challenges.
But we're doing better than we think and what the pessimists want us to believe.
Chapter three.
What can you do to make it better?
Enough with the complaining!
The world is full of social innovators, people who create ideas and tools that allow us all to live better, more sustainably and with more opportunities for all without having to give up progress.
If you want to meet them and learn what you can do to live up to your ideals, you'll find a selection of 120 in the book and more on that website.
We are not ants includes Global Voices in its selection of innovative platforms.
Through an innovative use of infographics and a combination of traditional and digital media, We Are Not Ants provides a balanced and critical view of the state of the planet, and offers concrete alternatives for change.
The book can be previewed on the website and can be purchased in paper or digital edition.

Serbia: Reactions to news of Serbian mercenaries in Libya
Serbian newspaper 'Alo' with a picture of Serbian mercenaries in Libya.
According to the Maltese blog Malta CC, Serbian military pilots are presumed to have been involved in the bombing of protesters in the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi.
This came to light after two Libyan pilots fled to Malta, refusing to bomb their fellow citizens who are taking part in the uprising in Libya.
In the same article, Alo revealed that allegedly Serbian mercenaries were killing protesters on the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi:
Serbian mercenaries earn tens of thousands of dollars for this work... They come from Serbia, but Bosnian and Croatian agencies are involved in recruiting them for this kind of work... The "Serbian Legionaries" are veterans of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia.
It can be expected that in the near future many of our contractors will go with Gaddafi, who has great confidence in the Serbian soldiers.
It seems that Serbian netizens are not too surprised by these accusations and revelations.
The Krstarica forum is one of the most debated venues.
No wonder, people.
The professionals are doing everything for money...
No emotion, no morals, and no more...
In the wars in the former Yugoslavia, they cooperated with Croats, Muslims, why wouldn't they work for Gaddafi now.
They don't give a shit who's boss.
Sicilian writes:
It's all right!
Gaddafi has always been on the Serbian side...
Soko observes:
He seems to believe more in Serbs...
Libya has not recognized Kosovo, another reason to support Gaddafi.
Donald 1408, a Serbian military officer, recalls:
Hey, gentlemen, what's so weird about that?
I know you were in Russian schools too.
Gaddafi's military experts appreciated the school in Yugoslavia...
He knew how to recruit the best to join the Libyan army...
Many were going to help the Libyans with special contracts... personally, I have an offer to go there, and I know I have many colleagues who were...
Visitors to the ultra-right forum "Stormfront" also discuss the alleged involvement of Serbian "war dogs" in Libya.
This is what you get for being a mercenary in Libya:

A declaration of love for the Portuguese language, in all its variants
The Portuguese language, spoken by over 200 million people worldwide, has often been described as the "homeland" or "motherland" of the Portuguese-speaking world.
On 21 February we commemorate the International Mother Language Day, established by UNESCO in 1999.
In a tribute to the Portuguese language in all its linguistic and cultural diversity, we invite you in this article to browse the reflections of Portuguese-speaking bloggers, sparked by your reading of the first novel dedicated to the Portuguese language, Milagrário Pessoal - the most recent work by Angolan author José Eduardo Agualusa.
The title of this article was taken from the Mértola blog, where Carlos Viegas writes that Milagrário Pessoal is:
Cameroon: Police use violence against protesters
Opposition groups in Cameroon organized protests on Wednesday, February 23, 2011, to demand that President Paul Biya step down.
The President wants to run again as a presidential candidate this year; he has been in power for 28 years.
His Special Intervention Brigade crushed the protest with force.
Writing about the protests, Eliza Anyangwe wonders why the protests in sub-Saharan Africa are not in the news:
Saudi women demand their rights on Twitter
It's a time of change in the Middle East and the Arab world and Saudi women don't want to be left behind.
Now they are demanding equality online - on Twitter, Facebook, forums and blogs.
Deborah Amos at Georgia Public Broadcasting reports that recent events have stirred political passions in Saudi Arabia:
"Duraa Ali, a 22-year-old journalism student, dressed in an abaya and veil on her face, asked in the forum if a woman could start a revolution in Saudi Arabia.
Women are the ones with the least rights, she said to applause in the room.
Ali was studying in Bahrain when the protests started there.
She was very moved by the demands of the Shiite protesters who challenged the Sunni royal family and disturbed by the violent reaction to the demands".
On Twitter #saudiwomenrevolution has a considerable number of followers and more tweets in support and sometimes against the women's demands are added every day.
Here is a snippet of the tweets from #saudiwomenrevolution
On Facebook, the Saudi Women's Revolution page has 591 followers and continues to grow.
Although most of the articles here are in Arabic, there are some comments in English and it has attracted support from non-Muslim men and women from various parts of the world.
The cartoons depicting Saudi women and their daily struggles are revealing, and some very moving.
While global support for Saudi women is growing, the authorities are certainly uncomfortable with the awakening of political awareness among the public.
James Nixon in Thniq says:
"A group of intellectuals, human rights activists and lawyers gathered on 10 February to form Saudi Arabia's first political party, the Islamic Umma Party, demanding an end to the country's absolute monarchy. They were all arrested on 18 February, with authorities demanding that they give up their demands in exchange for their release".
It will be hard for Saudi women and women calling for change, but as the events in Tunisia and Egypt show - the power of the people can never be ignored for long.
Bahrain: Day of Mourning is celebrated
This post is part of our special coverage of Bahrain Protests 2011.
Friday, February 25 was chosen as 'Day of Mourning' for all the martyrs who died since the Day of Rage protests, which began on February 14, 2011.

Bahrain: Protests in schools (Video)
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Bahrain Protests.
On Tuesday 1 March, several secondary schools organized anti-government protests across Bahrain.
Boys and girls schools in Ciudad Isa, Ciudad Hamad and Jidhafs marched in the middle of the school day to support the protesters camped in the Glorieta Perla (Lulu).
Schools in Ciudad Isa have turned to the Ministry of Education amid requests for the education minister's resignation and protests over the system of volunteer teachers adopted when teachers declared a strike to support the Glorieta Perla protesters and fallen martyrs.

Our first language stop is Aymara.
This language, spoken by more than two million people, is spoken in Bolivia, Peru, and Chile, and is recognized as an official language in the first two countries mentioned.
Aymara speakers are becoming more active on the web through projects like Jaqi Aru in El Alto, Bolivia, and, thanks to their translation efforts, Global Voices is now available in Aymara.
Below is a short video made by Choice Humanitarian Org to learn a few phrases in Aymara from native speakers:

Brazil: Critical Mass Tragedy - Accident or Murder?
From the website: "Together for more humane transit, for more beautiful and joyful cities, for a more breathable world: we are all part of Massa Crítica".
Critical Mass is an event that takes place in over 300 cities around the world, when tens, hundreds or even thousands of cyclists gather in the streets to urge the use of bicycles as an alternative mode of transport to motorized and polluting vehicles.
On the last Friday of February, the city of Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, held its own Critical Mass, but on February 25, 2011, a tragedy occurred.
Guilherme Valadares from the blog Papo de Homem explains:
@JessyAntonielle: if it was "without intent to kill", why did Ricardo José Neif LEAVE his car after the incident? #massacriticapoa
Permission to pedal? http://glo.bo/dQ1nEk #massacriticapoa
@luciouberdan: Is it that the police chief Gilberto Almeida Montenegro @policiacivilrs doesn't understand that the bicycle is a vehicle, and therefore a transit? #MassaCriticaPOA @tuliovianna: Police are investigating cyclist assault: http://is.gd/f3mrHo Are injuries to blame?!
That's attempted manslaughter!
There was no shortage of criticism of the coverage of the incident by local media, which treated it as a mere traffic accident.
Lucio Uberdan from Brazil Autogestionário comments:
A movement that proposes replacing the use of the car with the bicycle ends up, in this context, being an action of inconsistent , chickens  facing windmills  and therefore, nothing more logical than  ending the antics  (perhaps that was not only the thought of the driver who caused the accident, but also that of many readers of the newspaper).
On the corner of José do Patrocínio with Luiz Afonso, the Critical Mass of Porto Alegre suffered an attempted ASSESIMLATION, and it does not fool you when you read ACCIDENT on RBS and others.
A report by Igor Natusch of the blog Sul21 (Sur21) shows that the cyclists were deliberately run over.
Helton Scheer of Moraes, in a testimony reproduced on the group blog of Critical Mass, was one of the first to be hit by the car and comments:
The driver did not scratch anyone: he deliberately pushed a cyclist/bicycle with his car, threateningly, at least once after the mass hit. (...)
He had already surrounded  them since the beginning of the demonstration, that is, there are at least 500 meters, simply because the bikes were circulating all over the track, as is typical of Massa Crítica.
The Rio Grande do Sul Public Ministry will prosecute him for "attempted homicide, because it was a vain reason and the action made it difficult for the victims to defend themselves".
Ricardo Neif has a history of reverse driving, driving in sidewalks and being extremely aggressive.

Japan: Citizens video of earthquake
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Japan earthquake.
One has to admire people with the ingenuity to keep filming a video camera while the earth is shaking beneath them.
Citizen videos recorded on March 11 during the earthquake and tsunami that caused massive devastation in many parts of Japan are all over YouTube.
Among the many that have been shared online, here are a few.
The day of the great quake
Supermarket workers in Tokyo hold shelves during an earthquake that lasted for nearly a minute.
As the earthquake shakes a house, the people inside rush out onto the street.
These people watch from a high place as the tsunami submerges the port of Iioka in Chiba Prefecture.
At Shinjuku Station in Tokyo, March 11, people who couldn't get home after the earthquake.
Two days later
After the earthquake, a man reviewed the damage in Iioka, Chiba Prefecture, on March 13 and said: "The wave passed through the entire village".

Yemen: End of the game for Ali Abdullah Saleh?
This post is part of our special coverage Yemen Protests 2011.
March 18 was the bloodiest day since the uprising began in Yemen nearly two months ago, when Ali Abdullah Saleh repeatedly called for security forces to protect both pro- and anti-government protesters.
On Monday, Ali Muhsen, a senior Yemeni army officer, declared his support for "the peaceful revolution of the youth and their demands".
The military commander of the northern region, Ali Muhsen, on Monday declared his support for the peaceful revolution against the 33-year-old regime of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
General Mussen, a relative of President Saleh, is considered the second most influential military commander after Saleh.
Later on Monday, Ali Muhsen's action was followed by a massive wave of resignations by Yemeni officers, ambassadors, army generals and members of parliament.
Hameer Al-Ahmer, the Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, the Yemeni Ambassador to the Czech Republic, the Director of Yemeni Television, and the Governor of Aden are on this long list.

Myanmar: Photos from the earthquake
A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck northeastern Myanmar on the evening of Thursday, March 24, 2011.
The quake, which was felt in neighboring Thailand and even Vietnam and China, killed at least 70 people and destroyed more than 240 buildings in Myanmar alone.
Strong movements were also recorded in the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in Thailand.
The death toll could rise.
According to some reports, on Friday 25th morning, more than 80 coffins were sold in Tachileik.
Observers have described the earthquake as the third worst natural disaster to hit Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis (2008) and Cyclone Giri (2010).
The independent newspaper The Irrawaddy has interviewed some residents of Mae Sai, Thailand.
In a letter published in the Shan Herald, Jai Noi recounts the impact of the earthquake on residents.
Dear ones, we have all been up all night, dozing off while trying to stay awake.
The phone doesn't work well, neither the mobile nor the landline.
So far, the house has not been damaged.
We've been in and out all night.
I hope this email gets through.
There's a lot of damage in Taler, 40 kilometers north, and the bridge is shattered.
I heard most of the city came down and there's only one doctor there, so they sent more wounded to Tachileik than can be treated there.
At least 80 dead, I still have no details.
I'm sure there'll be more wounded.
The epicenter, as reported in the news, was near Merng Lain, 59 km north of Maesai.
There are still aftershocks.
The blog akm-kuntha has uploaded photos showing the damage on the roads in Tarle, a town 30 km from Tachileik.
Democratic Voice of Burma has also posted photos of the disaster.
Below I transcribe some reactions on Twitter from Yangon.
@ascmmr Dear Fans, we hope you are all well and safe from the earthquake.
If you felt the earthquake on March 24, 2011 at 8:25 pm
@minnyoonthit the earthquake has caused severe damage in northern Shan, Tachileik area (over 100 dead and several injured).

Although the UN in 2010 ranked Bolivia as the third largest coca producer, U.S. agents working for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have no plans to return there anytime soon.
In Bolivia, the case was observed as true.
Mexico: Marching against Violence or against Government?
The murder of journalist and poet Javier Sicilia's son, in the state of Morelos at the end of March this year, revived the wave of indignation in Mexico against violence and originated the aforementioned marches.
Mexicans protesting violence in the Zócalo in Mexico City.
Víctor Hernández, whose opinion appears on the blog Michoacán en Resistencia, celebrated that the marches were the product of citizen organization and not a media campaign orchestrated by some political current:
Poetized and politicized, multiclasses and indignant, more than 10 thousand people marched from the esplanade of Bellas Artes to the Zócalo of Mexico City to protest the effects of the war against narcotics, at the same time as another 8 thousand citizens, led by the poet and journalist Javier Sicilia, protested in Cuernavaca, the epicenter of this simultaneous protest, following the execution of 7 young people on March 28 in Temixco, Morelos.
Mexicans protesting violence in the Zócalo in Mexico City.
This is a very good idea.
And what's the solution?
I think all that is useless, violence is carried out by hit men lacking social training, guys without education most of the time, drug addicts, alcoholics, dehumanized people for whom killing someone is like when a salesman makes a sale.
Peru: Reactions after first round of 2011 elections

The day after the elections in Peru, the results are clear: there will be a second round, and so far, according to official figures from the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE), at 72.373% of the registered votes, Keiko Fujimori extends her advantage over Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and will be the rival of Ollanta Humala, who gets the first place with 29.02% of the votes.
Given that the ONPE count is a count of the votes cast, not a representative sample, it is clear that as the votes from the electoral acts coming from different corners of the country are added up, the results of Fujimori and Kuczynski may cross temporarily; but as the total of the votes cast approaches, it is unlikely that the trend expressed in the ballot box polls (Ollanta Humala first, Keiko Fujimori second, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski third) will change substantially.
Bloggers, candidates and analysts agree that this result is mainly "an angry vote", a vote of punishment for the economic policies handled by governments in recent years, which have fostered growth and created new prosperity that, interestingly, does not reach everyone equally, but rather has accentuated the gap between the extremes of the socioeconomic scale.
Roger Merino explains this clearly in his blog Legal Comparison and Critical Analysis:
Colombia: Indigenous communities protect their food security
Indigenous communities in Colombia are taking steps to protect their food security.
Not only are they instructing their communities to eat what their gardens produce instead of buying expensive food brought in from abroad, but they are also protesting against new laws and regulations that limit their access to milk.
Products sown in indigenous communities
In the next two videos, we can see the indigenous community of Misak, who along with others, marched to the capital city of Bogotá to protest a new law that makes the sale of raw milk illegal.
In their communities, where they buy milk from neighbors and supplement their diets locally, restricting raw milk would mean they would have to buy processed milk at a much higher price, affecting both milk producers and sellers.
These videos are titled "Milk and cans don't kill, hunger does".
You can follow this and other activities of indigenous communities in Colombia on their website in Spanish.
Interview with Gaël Brassac, translator for Global Voices
This interview is part of our series of portraits of Global Voices contributors.
Translators are behind-the-scenes collaborators who allow Global Voices readers to access our content in other languages.
Gaël Brassac, translator for Global Voices, in Kyoto in April 2010 and the following day in the city of Kyoto.
Interest in a particular country is often one of the reasons that leads a reader to become a Global Voices contributor.
Japan is at the center of Gaël's concerns at the moment, but it was his interest in Bangladesh that caught Global Voices' eye.
See here other portraits of Global Voices bloggers and translators from around the world.
Did you read Global Voices often before you started translating into French?
Gael Brassac: I discovered Global Voices in early 2009 at university, when I was doing research on monitoring geopolitical conflicts in Asian countries.
Sources of information were rare in the press, but on Global Voices I found a very good article by contributor Rezwan, and it helped me a lot!
Which of the Global Voices articles you translated has impacted you the most?
GB: One of the first I translated was about Egypt in June 2010, 'My name was Khalid and I was not a terrorist.'
It explained why this young Egyptian, who had incriminating videos of the local police, was killed by these same officers.
I preferred to commit to something where the main thing was solidarity and human beings, not money.
Now, I'm looking for humanitarian work in France, Japan or wherever.
GB: The week after the earthquake in Japan, the tsunami and the radiation leaks, I was very tense.
I followed the news closely but the large amount of conflicting information in the traditional media gradually discouraged me, and so as not to be so extreme, I chose a single source of information, a forum.
When a disaster like this happens in a country you have such fond memories of, a girlfriend, friends, and where you aspire to live, it's hard to handle.
But I'm sure Japan will come out of it as it did after World War II, and I hope it will adopt a progressive sustainable energy policy and make the right decision, just as it did when they wrote Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution in 1946 when they gave up war forever.
Chile: Let's get cyclists off the track
Blogger Setty criticizes a law that "seeks to ban bicycles on the street, and that puts the city's growing cycling population on the path".
Bolivia: Sharing a meal with Aymara women
Pablo Andrés Rivero blogs about a "ritual, collective meal from the Andean region" he shared with Aymara women in the municipality of Palca, near La Paz.
When he was almost finished eating, one of the women asked him "what do they eat in your country?", which prompted Andrés to reflect on the non-physical distance between the Aymara community and Bolivians like him.
There's nothing like a change in the weather to get people talking.
The reactions on Twitter were a mixture of shock, amazement, confusion and wishes for more to come.
Monday night showed a certain portent of the pleasant gift that was about to arrive.
Winds increase, gusts of 50kph afterwards... and forecast for rain (maybe thunderstorms?!) from 6pm onwards.
But the drops started in the afternoon, stopping and starting sporadically throughout the rest of the day.
@jmugford: @dohanews We have lightning in Duhail!
@hussdajani: ha, ha, well, my question comes back... what the hell is wrong with the weather in Qatar? #rain #hot http://yfrog.com/h85kptjj
Peru: The second round of elections begins
The candidates are Ollanta Humala and Keiko Fujimori.

With just weeks to go before the second round of the Peruvian elections, to choose between the candidate from Ghana Peru, Ollanta Humala Tasso and the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, Keiko Sofía Fujimori (for Fuerza 2011), the growing polarization of Peruvian society, and therefore of the electorate, is visible both in the press and on social networks.
The most high-profile news these days is the recent firing of two journalists from the local news channel Canal N, owned by Grupo El Comercio, allegedly for failing to follow the indications of doing a biased coverage in favor of Keiko Fujimori.
This has generated expressions of rejection from both journalists' organizations and the dismissed journalists' own colleagues.
Journalist Raúl Tola, a colleague of Patricia Montero and José Jara, asks in his column in the newspaper La República:
Honduras to implement one laptop per child program
RNS in Honduras Politics and Culture says the plan to give an XO laptop to every child in Honduras "would be ideal for the development of Honduras".
However, the blogger shows some skepticism: "At the current cost, the original $3 million investment would buy 15075 XO laptops, not the 8000 computers the article specifies".
Iraq: Is Saddam still alive?
Saddam Hussein is making a tour of social media, where a new recording claims that the Iraqi dictator is alive and well and that it was his double Mikhail who was executed on December 30, 2006.
Many netizens were quick to describe the video as fake and assure readers that Saddam is dead and buried.If he were alive, the former Iraqi dictator would have turned 74 on Thursday 28.There are also over 500 comments on the video, many from people who believe the video is a hoax and that Saddam is indeed dead.
Saddam Hussein was executed in 2006, why wait all those years to announce to the whole world that he is alive!!!?
The Iraqi youth are fed up with the occupation, fed up with the division whether sectarian or ethnic and they want to re-establish a united and independent Iraq.
From Saudi Arabia, Sultan Al Sulami is starting to smell something:
Today is the birthday of the President of the Republic of Iraq, the martyr Saddam Hussein.
Kuwait: Blogger wins lawsuit
Congratulations flow after Kuwaiti-based Lebanese blogger Mark won a lawsuit.
He was sued by a restaurant for a review he posted on his blog.
Puerto Rico: The debate on domestic violence continues
A few blogs have been closely following the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that victims of violence who are in adulterous relationships cannot be protected under Law 54 against Domestic Violence.
And recently, the Court of Appeals in San Juan (the capital city) ruled that another woman victim of domestic violence could not receive the protection offered by Law 54 because, allegedly, the relationship with the abuser was purely sexual.
It would be a mistake to assume that this right-wing phalanx is guided in its zeal by some very conservative political or judicial ideology or principle.
It seems to be guided by no judicial or political principle, only by partisan, cultural and perhaps religious loyalty.
Mexico prepares for massive nationwide protest on May 8
On Sunday, May 8, Mexican citizens will march to demand the end of the "War on Narcotics" and the resignation of all government officials responsible for more than 35,000 deaths and the increase in insecurity and corruption.
Mexican poet Javier Sicilia, who became the leading voice of discontent over the government's method of addressing the drug problem after his son Juan Francisco was murdered, is inviting all who want 'peace and justice' to join the protests next Sunday.
Here is the message from Javier Sicilia:
The protest began on May 5 in Cuernavaca, a city near the capital, where Sicily's son was killed, and will head to the National University (UNAM) in Mexico City.
Neftali Granados (@NeftaliGranados) tweeted the route to follow.
The itinerary of the protest in Mexico is available on the official website of Red Paz y Justicia.
A Facebook page has also been opened to spread details.
In addition, there will be an official blog dedicated to details of the various protests across the country.
The newspaper La Jornada fully supports the protest and constantly publishes editorials to push the goals of the May 8 protests.
Professor John M. Ackerman, a strong and respected voice in Mexican civil society, wrote:
Bolivia: Keeping the Aymara alive through TV?
M. Lukaña Champi wonders why Bolivia does not have a TV channel in Aymara or Quechua, considering that the country is run by an 'indigenous government': "Modern media, such as radio and television are ways to keep a language alive and in full use.
When a language is not used, that language dies".
Egypt: Companies help government spy on activists
One of the demands of the Egyptian revolution was the dissolution of the State Security Investigations and the prosecution of its officials, one of the most notorious security services for torture, human rights violations and spying on activists.
A few weeks ago, after no response from the authorities, Egyptian citizens broke into the SSI headquarters to protect evidence incriminating different departments of the agency (including torture equipment and documents), including communications between SSI units related to censorship, monitoring of online content, computer and laptop control, and shutting down communication services.
In my view, all individuals and entities working for the right to privacy, freedom of expression and other relevant areas should understand and be aware of the information these documents provide.
Since the first protest in Egypt on 6 April 2008, security agencies and services have decided to pay more attention to communications between activists via the Internet or mobile devices.
Shut down certain Internet sites.
Cutting off cell service at telecommunications companies.
The SSI held several meetings with representatives of the Ministry of Interior, the General Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the three telecommunications companies in Egypt (Vodafone, Mobinil, Etisalat).
These communications between different departments of the SSI mention that the price of the software, called Finfisher, was 2 million Egyptian pounds.
Here you can see how Gamma Group International is described on its website: provides advanced technical surveillance and international monitoring and advisory solutions to National and State Intelligence Departments and State Security Agencies".
The most recent release is dated 1 January 2011 and is a report by an IT department of SSI after having used a trial version of the software.
This type of program developed by Gamma International and similar, simply helps governments and agencies belonging to the regimes in power to violate the privacy of citizens, control their activities and impose censorship.
The same goes for telecommunications companies in Egypt that cooperated with the Mubarak regime to obtain information from activists and disrupt services.

Ecuador: Three years after Factory tragedy
Factory never again.
Image provided by Juan Arellano
On April 19, 2008, three years have passed since the Factory case, or the fire at the Factory disco in Quito, during a gothic rock festival.
As a result of the fire there were 19 dead and 24 injured.
The death toll included all members of the rock band Zelestial, and some of the survivors are still suffering from the aftermath of the tragedy.
Although there was a trial and sentencing for the case, the collective of relatives and friends of the deceased continue to gather to demand justice and above all the non-exclusion of rockers of various tendencies, allowing them to meet and perform anywhere in the city and not just in remote and dubious places of safety.
Spain: Earthquake shakes Murcia
Lorca, in the region of Murcia, Spain, was rocked by two earthquakes on May 11.
The earthquakes of magnitude 4.5 and 5.1 on the Richter scale, and the subsequent aftershocks, have left a total of nine dead so far and about 300 injured.
Thousands of damaged people have had to be housed in shelters.
Damned in the streets of Lorca.

Solidarity towards the so-called City of the Sun was immediately felt through Twitter, under the hashtags #terremotomurcia and #todosconlorca which have been used to inform and show solidarity.
On Facebook, the account Apoyo por el Terremoto de Murcia was opened, which already has thousands of messages, and in blogs of Murcia residents who share their grief, such as that of María en el Atelier.

I only hope that this country of solidarity, capable of allocating hundreds of millions of euros to the most pilgrim causes, will turn to helping and rebuilding, and I mean the government that is ruining us, to see where ZP comes out, will be worth seeing.
There are also criticisms of the lack of immediate intervention to help those left homeless on the first night, contrary to what is reported in official media.
As Kaos writes on the Net:
This post is part of a special coverage on the death of Osama Bin Laden.
For the United States government, "Geronimo EKIA" (short for "Enemy Killed in Action") is the code for the death of Osama Bin Laden.
For many Native Americans, however, comparing their tribal hero Geronimo to the world's number one terrorist is offensive.
Geronimo was the most famous Chiricahua Apache figure who fought against the Mexican and American armies to defend Apache lands.

It also serves to project the United States in a better light.
We are, after all, magnanimous in victory.
They won the fight by beating a legend.

In memory of Paulina Aguilera Muñoz, writer for Global Voices
The news came via email from her younger sister, Claudia: Paulina Aguilera Muñoz, Chilean author for Global Voices, had died unexpectedly.
As the Latin America Regional Editor for Global Voices, I had been in contact with Paulina the day before, working on a post about a blogger who had been arrested in Ecuador for alleged offenses against the Attorney General.
The news of his death was shocking and heartbreaking for the Global Voices community.
A journalist by profession and mother of two young girls, Paulina has worked in Argentina, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Colombia on development, human rights, gender and communications.
She was the blogger for Varios Mundos Para Vagabundos and Kanguro: Safe and Cheap Tourism.
There were countless messages of condolences and love as soon as I shared the news on our community mailing lists.
From all over Latin America, as well as from far away, such as India, Serbia, South Korea, Sweden, Bahrain, Maldives, Peru, Tanzania, Ukraine, Tunisia, France, Pakistan and the United States, her friends miss and remember her.
Solana Larsen, Global Voices Editor-in-Chief, wrote: "I remember her as someone who was cheerful and funny on the distribution list and also as a blogger who was enthusiastic and energetic in defending women's rights and indigenous rights", referring to a post Paulina wrote on her personal blog for Blog Action Day, where she wrote about clean water as a right of indigenous peoples.
Chilean author Felipe Cordero said he admired Paulina's dedication to covering human rights issues in Chile and Latin America for Global Voices.
Firuzeh Shokooh Valle, our editor of Spanish, recalled how much she enjoyed Paulina's post about Natividad Llanquileo, the indigenous spokesperson for the Mapuche on hunger strike in Chile.
Ela Stapley, a translator for Global Voices, mentioned Paulina's coverage of a prison fire in Chile: "I liked this post from her especially because it was about people that society prefers to forget.
In writing it, he reminded us that prisoners are people too".
Paulina was a key contributor in the coverage of the police strike that took place in Ecuador on September 30, 2010.
At Global Voices we will miss her dedication, professionalism and enthusiasm very much.
I will personally remember her as a friend and an exemplary woman.
Iran: Dogs arrested (again)
Iranian security forces are back on the streets for a sequel to their infamous 2007 action: arresting dogs.
The last offensive was short-lived and the dogs were soon released.
According to Iranian media, several dogs were recently confiscated and moved "temporarily to jail".
It is possible that because the people most likely to keep dogs are Iran's urban, educated youth, dogs may be generating more official hostility again.
Animal Persian blog writes with humor and irony about the serious crimes that animal lovers in Iran may be prosecuted for in the future:
Animal Persian posts a parody image of a 'crime scene' where the owner is labeled as 'delinquent' and the dog is the 'object of crime'.
Spain: Thousands take to the streets
Spanish citizens have taken to the streets this week to protest against corruption, poverty, unemployment and a political structure that favors a two-party system.

Ignacio Escolar in Público reports:
#15m, #15mani and #democraciarealya were the most actively used hashtags on Twitter related to the May 15 protests, to distribute thousands of links to photos and videos of the demonstrations in 50 cities, and news of the upcoming elections and citizen requests.
This is one of the most retweeted messages on May 16:
The following is a list of the main features of the website:

Iran: Campaign against homophobia: "We are everywhere"
Arsham Parsi is the founder and director of the Iranian Gay Organization based in Toronto, Canada.
In 2008, he told Global Voices, "The Internet has been a gift to us".
On May 17 this year, International Day Against Homophobia, several Iranians once again used this "gift" to raise their voices with the launch of the "We Are Everywhere" campaign, on YouTube, Facebook and blogs, against homophobia worldwide.
I hope that one day when I say I'm gay, I won't be accused of being a sinner or be mistreated.
My gay experience started with falling in love and I think everyone in this world can feel that.
I hope our days are filled with sunshine, rainbows and the joy of being able to talk without fear.
Brazil: Forest defender shot dead

Caribbean: Reflections on the end of the world
The world was supposed to end on Saturday the 21st - at least according to some religious sects.
Caribbean bloggers write about how one man's delusional idea impacted the region and put a humorous twist on surviving the end of the world.
Jamaican blogger Stunner's Afflictions was... let's say... shocked to discover that:
Global economy: Women reflect on poverty, work and debt
The International Women's Museum's online exhibition on women and the economy features slide passes, podcasts, videos and essays on women from countries such as Sudan, Denmark, the Philippines, the United States, Costa Rica, Mexico and Argentina and how they perceive issues like poverty, business, family, rights, money and more.
Economics, IMOW's interactive online exhibition, intends to explore the contribution of women to the global economy.
Images of Power and Potential, was a photo exhibition with a jury that showed the different ways in which women participate in the economy and their role as agents of change.
For example, the winner of the Community Choice award was Brenda Paik Suno, a third-generation Korean-American who took pictures of a 'Granny Jeju of the Sea', who has been part of the tradition of women harvesting at sea for generations.
The divers from the Jeju Islands.
This is a photo by Brenda Paik Suno.
Focusing on Latin America gives us insights into how the global crisis affected women in three different countries in the region, Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina, and how they faced new challenges, brought about by their countries' continuing growing participation in the global economy.
Young Women Talk about Economics asked women from four different countries to share their thoughts on various economic issues.
Ally Zeifman addressed the topic of relative poverty through audio interviews.
I started by asking people in Denmark if they thought there was poverty in Denmark, and then I interviewed a woman who believes she is one of the invisible poor in Denmark.
On the project page you can read an introduction to the topic and see photo passes with quotes from the interview that illustrate what the life of a poor person in Denmark is like.
Some of the quotes like "I graduated from college but I'm unemployed", "My son really wanted to play football but I don't have the money to pay for all the sneakers and sports equipment so in the end I decided it was better to put food on the table" and "I know I'm not poor like in Africa but I have to say 'no' often" resonate with all those who have been in a difficult economic situation.
Valeene Salanga from the Philippines reflects on how even a university education does not guarantee a better future, since getting a first job means traveling down a road full of obstacles that she had not counted on as a graduate:
There is much more to see, read and hear in Economics, and women can also participate and deliver their own creative work that focuses on economics.
Ukraine: Blogging to find a new identity
For someone living with drug addiction, becoming a substitution therapy patient involves significant changes in their life.
The process of returning to a normal life from a life of injecting drug use requires not only lifestyle changes, but also changes at the psychological level.

Mexico: Teacher sings with students during shooting
The YouTube video showing a kindergarten teacher singing with her students to keep them calm during a shooting in Monterrey, Mexico, has gone viral across Spanish-speaking countries.
The video recorded by the teacher with a cell phone shows a classroom full of very young children lying on the floor.
The teacher is heard gently asking her students to keep their heads down, glued to the floor, while gunshots are heard in the background.
She reassures the children by telling them that everything is fine, and that they will be safe inside the classroom, and reminding them to keep their heads down.
To distract them, she starts singing with them.
Choose the Rain Drop Song from Barney's show in Spanish, which talks about what would happen if raindrops were made of chocolate and how they would open their mouths wide to take them.
By making the children sing the song, he not only kept them calm but also got them to keep their heads glued to the floor, while he asked them to turn up to look up at the sky with their mouths open.
Local media have identified the school as being located in Colonia Nueva Estanzuela, just metres away from where a group armed with seven vans went on to murder five people in an independent taxi stand, and the teacher, whose identity is still unknown, has been called a hero and has been recognized by the media and viewers for her courage, character and love for her pupils.

"Stop the bullets, paint the fountains" is a social movement that calls for justice and recalls the actions of the Mexican government in several crimes that have not had a clear judicial process.
To the amazement of pedestrians who circled around the capital during the last weekend of May, activists dyed red the water of the famous statue of "Diana the Hunter" on Paseo de la Reforma - one of the most important avenues in Mexico City.
The police tried to stop the protest, but thanks to its peaceful nature, the participants were allowed to continue their demonstration.

This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Japan earthquake.
More than two months have passed since the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan, and while those not directly affected by the disaster have been able to return to their normal lives, some 110,000 people are still living in evacuation centers, according to police estimates.
The lack of privacy, separation from their communities of origin, unemployment and deep grief over the loss of their loved ones has been a heartbreaking experience for many victims who are physically and emotionally exhausted.

Iran: Women's rights activist dies at father's funeral
Iranian women's rights activist Haleh Sahabi died on Tuesday, May 31, as a result of beatings by security agents during the funeral of her father, Ezatollah Sahabi, a veteran political leader.
Haleh was leading the procession with flowers and a photo of her father, when plainclothes officers broke in and tried to break the photo.
According to witnesses, security officers used batons.
His death made headlines on several news websites.
Another blogger, Artenoos, wrote:
Haleh (56) was a women's rights activist and a Quranic researcher.
She was arrested on 5 August 2009, when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected for a second term.
She believed that equality between men and women could be found if the Koran was read through the prism and concerns of a woman.
Does no one remember, "you get something, you get something if you finish it"?
Peru: Aymara Indians announce resumption of protests in Puno

It is worth recalling that in recent days, about 15,000 Aymara took over the city of Puno, after which violent incidents broke out that paralyzed the Pune capital for several days and left many tourists stranded.
The Puno region, far from the capital Lima, bordering Bolivia, is the second largest in terms of hectares granted for mining projects in Peru, according to the scholar José de Echave.
The Central Government has rejected the cancellation, but reached an agreement with the Aymara communities to suspend mining and oil concessions in Puno for 14 months in four provinces (Yunguyo, Chucuito, Collao and Juli).
However, these indigenous communities also demand that the Supreme Decree 082-2007-EM be abrogated, as stated by Walter Aduviri, President of the Natural Resources Defense Front of the southern Puno area.
Aduviri pointed out to the Pune newspaper Los Andes that, although they felt positive about the victory of nationalist candidate Ollanta Humala, the Aymara will not conform to promises, but demand written agreements.
Lake Titicaca, whose ecology would be affected by mining and oil activities according to Aymara activists (Photo: J. Enrique Molina)
The Quechua and Aymara people of Puno are not opposed to mining completely, but want to be included in the process of granting licenses, to define where it is convenient to extract minerals to avoid contaminating the basins of their rivers and reaching Lake Titicaca.
Despite this, they cultivate more than a thousand varieties of native potatoes and hold the first place in national production of this tuber.
Colombia: Robbery at the Andean Parliament
On June 7, the seat of the Andean Parliament in Bogotá, Colombia, was stormed.
The Andean Parliament is the controlling body of the Andean Community, a regional body made up of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru with the aim of achieving "an integral, more balanced and autonomous development, through Andean, South American and Latin American integration".
The blog Planeta al día reports the news as follows:
Tapia is the host of a boxing program on Thursday nights at nine.
He always devotes the first minutes to political reflection and criticism, which in many cases generates rejection and in others sympathy.
It is one of the most popular shows on Panamanian television and the reactions around his possible candidacy were not long in coming.
Panamanian blogger Leslie Martinez writes in her blog Bla bla bla of a Panamanian about her stance on the matter:
My impression of Juan Carlos Tapia is 1.
IN political notes Jamas voted for Juan Carlos Tapia, he talks, he talks and he talks, that's all he does!
I never get him to do anything!
The population seems to be watching and waiting for a new figure.
China: Internet users running for election
Originally published on 26 May 2011.
Amidst the news about the Fuzhou blasts, something strange was happening on Sina Weibo: earlier this week, citizens across the country began announcing their decision to stand as independent candidates in the municipal district-level local elections to the People's Congress to be held next fall.
This vote is open to the public.
Among them are journalists Li Chengpeng and Yao Bo.
Although there are precedents (Yao Lifa's victory in 1998, which gave him a seat in the municipal People's Congress in Hubei province and caused many others to try to follow in his footsteps), the Weibo list is unique because of the popularity of several of the participants and that almost all of them have started campaigning on their microblogs.

Cambodia: Women entrepreneurs and social media
Since then, several formal meetings have been held with the support of the International Finance Corporation in Cambodia.
The first informal meeting was successfully organised in the first week of June, with the support of individual donations.
On June 3, about 40 members of the group met to discuss Facebook's role in the development of their businesses.
The meeting was attended by bloggers, online entrepreneurs, businesswomen and civil society organizations.

The debate initially focused on the emergence of new social communication tools that can reach a larger and more specialised target audience, compared to traditional media.
Then, panelists and attendees shared some tips on how to improve their business expansion on Facebook.

Ethan Zuckerman, co-founder of Global Voices and longtime fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, has been named director of the MIT Citizen Media Center and senior research scientist at the MIT Media Laboratories.
The research center (formerly known as the Center for Future Citizen Media) was founded in 2007 with support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to explore the opportunities and challenges of news and information in a digital age.
And that is a topic that is really central and a priority of much of the work done at the Center for Future Citizens' Media.
In his blog, Ethan says he's excited that the Center will be working on a combination of practical and theoretical projects:

Video: Celebrating the solstice
Lanterns, dancing, flowers, and bonfires were among the elements used in celebrations around the world for the summer and winter solstices.
Let's take a trip around the world to see the different celebrations: the solstice at Stonehenge, the bonfires at the Feast of St. John in Spain, the Inti Raymi in Peru, we tripantu in Chile and Kupala Day in Russia or summer night in Poland.

In A Coruña, Spain, bonfires, drinks and parades marked the festivities of the San Juan bonfires.
It is traditional for children and teenagers to jump over fires a certain number of times for good luck.
Sadly, this year's celebrations were marred by the deaths of two people, one of whom died from tripping while trying to jump over one of the larger fires, and perished in the middle of the fire in the face of unsuccessful attempts by spectators to rescue him.
I'm not sure what you mean.
In front of the Sacsayhuamán temple in Cusco, Peru, the traditional celebration of Inti Raymi, which marks the beginning of the Inca new year, is recreated every year.
The last Inti Raymi celebrated by the Incas took place in 1535, after which the Catholic Church and the Spanish Conquest put an end to it.
In 1944 the celebrations were resumed, following the descriptions of the Inca historian Garcilaso de la Vega.
We Tripantu is a celebration of the Mapuche Indians to recognize the beginning of a new year at the winter solstice.
The following video shows schoolchildren in Chile dancing in a celebration of this indigenous festival:
In the village of Maloyaroslavets in Russia, Ivan Kupala Day is celebrated, and on this summer holiday, the tradition is kept alive with girls wearing flowers in their hair, community fires and dancing:
And last but not least, a record-breaking celebration in Poland, where thousands of paper lanterns are lit and let fly through the night sky.
The magical videos speak for themselves (via Neatorama):
Did you celebrate the solstice?

Cuba: Vote in favour of LGBT resolution of UN Human Rights Council
On Friday, June 17, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution expressing "grave concern about acts of violence and discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual orientation . . . ".
As part of the resolution, the Council requested a comprehensive study on discrimination against the LGBT community around the world.
The Cuban vote in favour shows the political will of our Party and State to eliminate all forms of discrimination which unfortunately still persist in Cuban society.
Paquito el de Cuba, one of the most "noisy" LGBT advocates in the Cuban blogging community, wrote of the great achievement this measure represents.
...the national printed newspapers... had no dispatch from that news agency to report on the event.
What prevented the adaptation of the information provided by Cuban digital sites to the printed versions of the newspapers?
Morocco: A new constitution with few reforms
This post is part of our special coverage Protests in Morocco 2011.
Moroccans went to the polls on Friday 1 to vote on the reform of the new constitution proposed by King Mohammed VI.
Although many analysts and monarchists have praised the reforms, they fall short of the expectations of politicians and activists, who sought a true democracy, with separation of powers and the transfer of absolute power from the monarch to an elected parliament.
The king's offer comes after four months of street protests demanding reforms that followed the revolutions in Tunisia and Egypt on February 20.

Morocco: Protests for reforms continue
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Protests in Morocco.
On Friday, July 1, 2011, Morocco voted in a referendum on the draft constitution proposed by King Mohammed VI.
The official results of the referendum indicated that support for the reform had been overwhelming, with over 98% of the votes cast in favour of the 'Yes' option.
Those protesting in favor of democracy demanded the establishment of a parliamentary monarchy in which there would be an effective separation of powers.
The pro-democracy movement responded to the announcement of the results with the complaint that there had been irregularities in the entire process and some bloggers have posted videos from the day of the referendum in which it is alleged that the electoral law is being violated.
The following video was posted on the 24-Mamfakinch blog, in which unidentified individuals appear, allegedly trying to force an election ballot box after the school closes and before the counting begins.
Although the referendum confirmed support for the constitutional reform, thousands of people took to the streets on Sunday to protest against the proposal.
In addition, on that same day there were rallies in support of the monarch, who continues to enjoy great popularity.
The videos below were recorded in Tangier, Rabat and Casablanca, respectively, and published on 24-Mamfakinch:
The protesters say the changes will not be deep enough and that they will continue to put pressure on the regime until they feel that real reforms are being implemented.

Bulgaria: A day without Prime Minister Boyko Borisov
July 5, 2011 brought an interesting challenge to the mainstream Bulgarian media: would they follow a Facebook call for "A day without Boyko Borisov" - or would they continue to report on the activities of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?
Reuters took note of the call on Facebook, and posted it on its cables, under the headline that was very much in line with the organizers' intention: "Bulgarians pray for a day without busy Prime Minister Borisov".
Boyko Borisov, Prime Minister of Bulgaria.

However, the Bulgarian media, with two memorable exceptions - the BGNES news agency and the Mediapool Internet site - did not follow suit and continued to include the Prime Minister in their stories.
Other bloggers also noticed and wrote about the initiative, sometimes with comments or ironic and sarcastic headlines for their posts, addressed to the Prime Minister.
In a very passionate and sad post, Nelly from Politics is arts was very critical of the Bulgarian media, asking why "I have to read news from foreign sites, watch foreign TV channels and prefer the opinion of bloggers over that of journalists".
Prime Minister Borisov himself announced that he was not interested in such events, and then immediately commented that the organizers were being paid by the opposition.
One of the event organizers, Mr. Atanas Palov, called this ridiculous, and joked that if the Prime Minister paid enough, they could create an alternative event "A Day with Boyko Borisov".
The three young people (the other two are Misses Kamelia Encheva and Valia Krusheva) who came up with the idea have denied political involvement: one of them lives in Austria, one in Belgium and the other in Bulgaria, and they do not seem to have any political motivation.
It was chosen on July 5 because that day was two years since the 2009 elections, in which Borisov was the winner.
At the end of the event, the organizers published an open letter, in which they explained that the initiative was not directed at the Prime Minister, but rather towards the attention that the Bulgarian media is giving to Boyko Borisov.
Wikimedia Bolivia organized first event for local Wikipedia editors and readers
The Bolivian chapter of Wikimedia brought together local Wikipedia editors and readers for the first time.
The event included a workshop for current and future content publishers.

Videos: Tortillas, chapatis, bread and more from around the world
Puto, steamed rice cakes from the Philippines.
Most cultures accompany their meals with a cereal product: bread, chapatis and steamed buns are part of the meals of many people in different parts of the world.
We'll make our first stop in France, where baker Vincent Talleu makes croissants, chocolate neapolitan and other similar products using the same pasta as a base:
In India, flatbread known as roti, chapati or parottas accompanies most meals and is quite a spectacle to watch how it is made.
Here we see a woman cooking roti chapatis in her kitchen, flattening them with a kneading roll on a wooden board, cooking them in a flat metal pan or pan, and then topping them on an open flame, where they inflate like balloons:
The following videos offer other examples of the breadmakers' skill: from the speed and agility of shaping, paving and grinding the chapatis to cook inside a traditional oven to a production line where they fly parottas through the air before ending up in the oven:
I'm not going to lie.
Across Central America, the corn tortilla is the staple food for much of the population.
Although freshly made tortillas can be purchased, some people still cook them using traditional techniques.
In Zacualtipán, in the state of Hidalgo (Mexico), a kitchen with a century of history is the scene where corn is ground or dough is prepared on a metate stone, the tortilla is pounded until it takes its typical round shape and then cooked in a wood oven:
This woman flattens the tortillas with a piece of plastic bag on a table so she can twist them comfortably while shaping them:
In Turkey, the local flatbread is called yufka.
This video shows a man turning the mass into giant paper-thin circles:
In the Philippines, the traditional food is puto, a steamed rice cake that can be eaten alone or with sweets and salt.
This one's made with coconut milk and rice flour:
And this is with regular flour, which produces something very similar to American pancake dough, but steamed:
I'm not sure what you mean.
In Colombia and Venezuela, the corn dough is used to make arepas, which are thicker than tortillas and come in different varieties and sizes.
This video was uploaded by a street vendor of arepas from Cali, Colombia, who says where to buy his arepas with cheese throughout the day.
Food blogger, chef John of Foodwishes.com tried his luck making Venezuelan arepas, which he stuffed with pork, making his own version of what is known in Venezuela as "hairy" arepa:
Bolivia: War Cholitas in the spotlight
For over ten years, women's wrestling has captured the attention of locals and visitors in El Alto, Bolivia.
These women add a little tradition to this popular sport: Where else could you see mares in colorful pollers, fringed shawls, thick braids, and bowler hats fighting in a ring?

Sara Shahriari and Tim Clayton collaborated on the following video about Yolanda la amorosa, a fighter from El Alto who, despite her mother's concerns, steps up to the ring to fight for her right to be more than what society considers "appropriate" for a woman.
Wrestling is a Bolivian experience par excellence and we recommend it.
It seems that in Iran even the statues are safe.
Religious motives are said to be behind the recent theft of several bronze statues in public places, representing Iranian national heroes.
Iranian mythological hero and archer, Arash Kamangir.
The official reason was ostentatiously that the horses in Imam Square could be interpreted as an insult to the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomenei.
It is said that Kamangir put his own life into his arrow and used it to expand Iran's borders.
Azarmehr writes that more statues are being targeted these days, as Iranian authorities continue their rage against Iran's pre-Islamic history.
However, since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, the Islamic Republic has remained on its knees before the anti-Iranian agenda.
Some bloggers like Osyan Sabz have photographed the empty places left after the statues were removed and destroyed:
At least for Sari's riders, sadly it's too late.

Colombia: Singer Joe Arroyo has died
The Colombian singer Álvaro José Arroyo González, better known as Joe Arroyo, who was born in a humble neighborhood of Cartagena on November 1, 1955, died today July 26 at 07:45 A.M. in Barranquilla, due to various organic complications that had him admitted to the La Asunción Clinic in Barranquilla for 29 days to end with a cardio-respiratory stoppage.
Joe Arroyo began his career at the age of 8 and went through several orchestras performing in the country, but became famous when he was with the orchestra Fruko and his Tesos .

Blogging Festival: Mexico - Citizenship, violence and blogs
Global Voices in Spanish is interested in encouraging blogging and promoting blogger networks, and it has been thought that a good way to achieve this can be through the well-known "Blog Festivals".
In this way, while GV en Español would be helping to generate original content with a certain level of reflection and analysis, the participating bloggers would benefit from greater visibility of their work being referenced on Global Voices.
But let's look at the details of the Festival:
Scope: Mexico
As the location and geographical scope of our first Blog Festival in 2011 Mexico has been chosen, a great country that is going through a constant cycle of violence.
In addition, we have several partners in Mexico who will support us in the dissemination of this virtual event.
While the largest number of bloggers, and the most well-known, are in Mexico City, we expect the participation of bloggers from cities like Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Ciudad Juárez and others.
We even expect participation from Mexican bloggers living outside their country.
We clarify that participation is not restricted to bloggers or blogs that are dedicated exclusively to the topic indicated in the following paragraph, any blog and blogger can participate.
Subject: Citizenship, violence and blogs
In a context like this, there are always stories that don't show up in traditional media, stories of resilience that we should know about.
Is it advisable to regulate media coverage of violence? If so, who would do it: readers, media, NGOs or government?
Are there tangible results from the activism campaigns (online or offline) against violence in Mexico?
Has the use of the Internet had an impact on the prevention or visibility of violent incidents, given that not all of these incidents are reported in traditional media?
Could or should new media go beyond the job of coverage and reflection?
Participation:
Any Mexican blogger can participate by posting a post on the proposed topic on their own blog.
The post must be original, i.e. created by the blogger himself, not copied from another source.
The structure, style and length of the post are at the discretion of the blogger.
It should be made clear that the approach to the subject is open-ended.
It can be from some of the suggested questions or from those the blogger considers appropriate.
When the blogger has published his post for the Festival, he must communicate it to this email: juan.arellano arroba globalvoicesonline punto org stating the following:
Name of the author
Name of the blog
Title of the post
Permanent link or URL of the post.
There is a button available, the image of this post, for bloggers to use and post on their blogs as a sign of participation.
Once you have the button on your blog, you should reference this post.
At the end of the participation period, the participants will be sorted and summarized for the purpose of publishing a compilation post on Global Voices.
Depending on the number of entries, posts may or may not be cited, mainly for space reasons.
Timetable: The activities to be carried out within the blog festival will be as follows:
From 29 July to 10 August.
- Period of participation.
From 1 to 10 August.
- Selection period and preparation of the summary post with the entries.
From 11 to 15 August.
- Posting the summary post on Global Voices in Spanish.
One more thing: This is not a contest, so there are no winners and no losers.
It is a question of seeking input, collaboration and testimonies on the proposed topic, so as to be able to draw up a broad, varied and updated overview of the same.
Twitter sharing
This time we want the Festival to be present and active on Twitter, for which we make available to all Twitter users the official hashtag of the Festival: #vocesmx
With this tag will be done all the work of dissemination and call to participate in the Festival, but we also hope that there are tweets alluding to the theme of the Festival with this hashtag.
We will follow them and a selection of the most interesting will be published in our summary post.
And well, we look forward to your support, collaboration and participation!

Bangladesh: Indigenous or non-indigenous, that is the question
Almost 98% of people in Bangladesh are Bengali and speak Bengali.
Minorities include the Chakmas, Khasi, Santal and other tribes that number over a million (about 1.2% of the total population) and most of whom live in the various mountainous regions.
The Chakmas are ethnically Tibetan-Burmese, and are related to the Himalayan tribes.
According to history, they originated in Arakan (now Rakhine State of Burma), which hundreds of years ago wandered and settled in different parts of India and Bangladesh.
In recent months, many indigenous people in Bangladesh have taken to the streets for rallies, human chains and demonstrations, demanding constitutional recognition of their identity.
The 'indigenous' debate arose after some comments from a special parliamentary committee working to amend the current constitution to return to the 1972 constitution.
There were no references to tribal or indigenous peoples in Bangladesh's first Constitution of 1972, where it was mentioned that Bangladesh would be the land of Bengalis.
Members of indigenous communities demanded their constitutional recognition as indigenous peoples instead of tribal or proposed minority ethnic groups at the Shahidminar in central Dhaka, Bangladesh.

The Minister of State for Cultural Affairs, Pramod Mankin said:
It is not a question of whether indigenous peoples will receive constitutional recognition.
The debate is on how they will be recognized .
The government is reluctant to recognize indigenous peoples as  indigenous  as it questions the ethnicity of the country's native Bengali people.
Monjurul Haque on the blog Indigenous Bangla writes about the complexity of the situation:
"In the Constitution, all minorities are recognized generically as minorities, and through the Fifteenth Amendment, the present government has categorized them as 'ethnic minorities' and no longer just as 'tribal peoples.'"
Giving a special and elevated identity to emancipate only 1.2 percent of a total population of 150 million by taking away the right to 98.8 percent cannot be in Bangladesh's national interest".
He recalled the 4000-year-old tradition of Bengalis in this land:
Bengali people are not settlers, nor are they foreigners or indigenous in their own native land and never will be
Colombia: Police dancers welcome footballers
In Medellin, Colombia, police officers welcomed England's U-20 football team to the airport with a dance, which made a good impression on visitors but left some locals concerned about their safety.
The city of Medellin is hosting the FIFA U-20 World Cup, and the Football Association (AF) posted a video of the city's welcome to the England U-20 team in a post titled 'A crazy Colombian welcome'.

Syria: Tanks enter Hama on the eve of Ramadan
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Syrian protests.
On the eve of Ramadan, Syrian troops have entered the city of Hama killing, it is reported, at least 45 people as of 11:00 am on Sunday, July 31.
The assault has had a particular resonance for Syrians, as the city of Hama was the scene of one of the most horrific massacres in modern history.
Most of the tweets in these early hours have been links to news, with many inside Syria and abroad condemning the killings, some expressing anger at what they perceive as international indifference.
However, others like deekelgen963, expressed doubts about the information coming from Hama.
From the original reports coming through the Twitter lines, a highlight.
Debkafile reports: "Water, electricity and telephone lines have been cut off for Hama's 400,000 residents".
Meanwhile, from inside Hama, some videos have come to light.
Another video shows black smoke rising from the city:
BBC journalist Shaimaa Khalil pointed to live video streams broadcast from inside Hama, the archive of which is still available here.
With no professional journalists in Hama, the reports are based on activist journalists and citizens, who are heavily exposed by capturing these images and videos.
As a result, news often takes time to surface, but some Syrian activists like @wissamtarif and @malathaumran are constantly tweeting news.
Mexico: Remembering the women of Ciudad Juárez
Women are not immune to this violence, and cases of femicide committed three years ago remain unsolved.
Ciudad Juárez is a border city, well north of Mexico, bordering El Paso, Texas.
It is a strategic location for drug and human trafficking and as such has suffered an unprecedented escalation of violence that has now left the entire population in complete terror.
We are, without a doubt, facing a humanitarian emergency.Journalist Judith Torrea has been reporting from the US-Mexico border for over a decade.
These women acted courageously despite being abandoned by the state.
Finally, she talks about the future of women-led activism in Mexico:
The future of activism in Mexico is bleak: a few days ago, the house of Malú García Andrade, who runs the NGO Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa, was burned while she was protesting.
This post (originally published on March 8) is part of our special coverage of the War on Drug Trafficking in Mexico.
Global Voices in Aymara: Preserving indigenous languages on the web
This post is part of our special coverage on Languages and the Internet.
One of Global Voices Lingua's newest sites is also the first in an indigenous language, Aymara.
This native language is spoken by more than 2 million people across the Andes, especially in Bolivia and Peru, where it is among the official languages.
There are also Aymara speakers in parts of Chile and Argentina, as well as Aymara living abroad.
The first translation of Global Voices into Aymara was published in September 2009 and continued with intermittent publications over the next year.
Once Victoria Tinta took over as editor, the site began producing regular translations from Global Voices in Spanish into Aymara.
In addition to proofreading and formatting translations, Victoria has been responsible for recruiting and coordinating the team of volunteer translators.
In total, there have been 21 volunteers who have contributed to a translation, and there is a core group of about a dozen who have done regular translations.
Aymara editor of Global Voices, Victoria Tinta at the Brazilian Forum for Digital Culture in São Paulo in October 2010.
The new site is an initiative of the Jaqi Aru project based in El Alto, Bolivia and aims to contribute to the availability of Aymara language content on the internet, as a way to promote and preserve their native language.
Most of the translators and members of the Jaqi Aru project are students at the Department of Linguistics of the University of El Alto (UPEA), and they have a passion for preserving the language for future generations.
The partnership with Global Voices allows the group to provide valuable content in Aymara about current events and cultural issues around the world.
Although all the translators are bilingual in Aymara and Spanish, and in some cases, multilingual, this translation project is still in its early stages.
In many cases, there are no Aymara words for texts appearing in Global Voices articles.
To help in such cases, there are projects like Runasimipi that try to reach consensus for the translation of a particular word, especially words related to technology.
But in many cases, these translations are an individual proposal for how some (text) should be translated. This interpretation may vary from translator to translator, but starting this way leaves room for discussion, thus helping each translator to perfect their work.
Members of the Global Voices Aymara translation team.
It may be true that most Global Voices Aymara readers have no problem reading Global Voices in Spanish as well, but the project is part of a larger goal to encourage Aymara speakers, especially young people, to embrace their ancestors' language.
Producing interesting content on the Internet is just the first step of the Jaqi Aru project and the Global Voices Aymara translation team hopes to be an example to other indigenous and minority language communities around the world.
This post is part of our special coverage on Languages and the Internet.
Before the case was mentioned by the mainstream media, the online community had organized a flashmob at the university.

Togo: Journalists rally to protect press freedom
On August 6, 2011, journalists in Togo, a country located in West Africa, held a rally in the streets of the capital, Lomé, to protest against the threats their colleagues have received recently.
The meeting was launched on 3 August by the SOS Journalistes en Danger Association.
The banner of the association SOS Journalists in Danger in Togo
In the week before the event, several media professionals from the association warned about threats to groups of Togolese journalists who are believed to be "critical of the government".
According to Ferdinand Ayité, president of the association, the threats originated from the ANR, the National Intelligence Agency (French acronym).
Mexico: Celebrating 100 years of Cantinflas
This August, Mexico celebrates the 100th anniversary of the birth of comedian Mario Moreno, better known as Cantinflas.
In Mexico and throughout Latin America, Cantinflas is recognized as a great actor and one of Mexico's most admired comedians.
Even after his death, Cantinflas continues to do so through his films.
Cantinflas was a symbol: with his euphemisms, his humility, warmth and, above all, with his sense of humor, he represented an entire country.
Fans are celebrating Cantinflas' birthday.

Cantinflas is still a movie star in the village.
In the same post he mentions the importance of Cantinflas in other continents:
Brazil: Teachers protest for better wages
Brazilian blogger Rosangela Basso posts several photos and videos of the most recent teachers' protest that took place on August 9 in the city of Rio de Janeiro, where teachers are demanding a substantial pay rise while the local government refuses to negotiate.
Chile: Live broadcast of the March for Education Reform on 18 August
Today's march for education reform can be followed live via Citizen Intelligent and Common Sense.
On Twitter, netizens are using the hashtags #18deagosto, #marchadelosumbrellas, #marchaestudiantil, and others to tweet about the protest.
Chile: New partnership between Global Voices and Mi Voz
Global Voices and Mi Voz - a Chilean network of electronic citizen newspapers - have just launched a content alliance.
Global Voices will publish a monthly article with stories from Mi Voz, amplifying the voices of its citizen correspondents to an international audience.
Mi Voz will publish an article prepared by Global Voices with content previously agreed by the editors of both organizations.
In addition, both will share content freely, according to a Creative Commons policy.
Global Voices readers already know a little bit about the work of Mi Voz thanks to the articles written by Katie Manning, a reporter for Mi Voz and the first contact to start conversations and make this alliance possible.
Katie will continue to share content from My Voice in English for Global Voices.
With this partnership, Global Voices will enrich its coverage of Chilean news from a hyperlocal citizen perspective focused on news outside the capital, Santiago.
Mi Voz has over 10,000 citizen journalists writing for its 18 media outlets from 14 regions across the country.
Founded in 2005, Mi Voz explains that its inspiration "is to generate media spaces, which enable society to actively engage in dialogue, creation and action, of the aspects that are significant for the local community".
My Voice announced this alliance on the 14th of Paradise.
Puerto Rico: Tropical Storm Irene leaves damage and heavy rains
Tropical Storm Irene made landfall in Puerto Rico on August 21 leaving strong winds, flooding, rains and the evacuation of entire communities.
Indymedia notes that poor black women were the most affected by the weather phenomenon:
The communities most likely to be affected by flooding are in coastal towns with a larger population of black families.
Today we saw that with a storm the country collapses.
Of course, in the midst of all this, the digital humor newspaper El Ñame could not help but launch a puja against the notorious bad electricity service after the storms had rocked the country.
Bolivia: Aymara women work as 'voice speakers' in El Alto
Alberto Medrano shares two videos of Aymara women in El Alto working in minibuses as voiceovers: women announcing the route of the vehicle and charging the passengers.
Cristina Quisbert blogged about these women in 2008 in Indigenous Bolivia.
Regarding opinions on the number of immigrants in Spain (according to official figures, 5,056,256 as of March), the NeoBandam page recalls that:
As early as 2010, the Madrid-based Movement Against Intolerance warned of the links between the economic crisis and the rise of xenophobia in the country.
The news out of August about PxC is not exhausted in this attempt to protest against what they consider the benefits of immigrants, especially Muslims, in Catalonia.
PxC is not opposed to immigration, but it is opposed to the settlement of Muslim immigrants in our country, a phenomenon which may in the long term pose a clear threat to our culture.
But, in all this context, it is interesting to consider what the blog Inmigrantes en España calls an operation of erasure  of denunciations and criminal proceedings of racist crimes on Spanish territory , which manifests itself in the absence of public debates on the subject:
Singapore elects new president
Dr. Tony Tan was elected the seventh president of Singapore on August 27, but his margin of victory was only 7,269 votes.
However, under our simple majority system, the elections have produced a clear winner, who has the mandate to be the next President.
AKIKONOMU explains why the presidency is fundamentally a ceremonial position:
The political landscape has changed, according to Yee Jenn Yong:
Iran: New demonstrations to save Lake Urmia
Once again thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Tabriz and Urmia, in Iran's Azerbaijan region, to demand the Iranian government save the dying Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest saltwater lakes.
Saving a dying lake to save a country

The news was censored in the Iranian-based media, but several videos were posted online on YouTube and bloggers flooded the blogosphere with posts on the subject.
Blogger Urmuiscierli writes that there have been street clashes with security forces beating and arresting protesters and even tying them to trees.
Some bloggers called for more Iranians to support Azerbaijani activists and revive demonstrations in the country.
The construction of a dam on part of the lake, in addition to the recent drought, has significantly reduced the amount of water the Urmia receives.
This has increased salinity, driven away many birds, and caused permanent damage to the ecosystem.
If the lake dries up, millions of people in the region will need to move elsewhere to survive.
Protests in Urmia
1freecountry writes that Lake Urmia does not distinguish between Tehran and Tabriz, that we should organize everywhere in the coming weeks.
Mosbate1000 says that:
We should be aware that the Revolutionary Guards have a cyber armed force; sometimes like this they publish and share contacts intended to divide Iranians.
Doughodushab calls on Iranians to defend Lake Urmia and Azerbaijan.
The blogger says that we are all trapped by the Islamic regime and that we should protect our natural and cultural heritage.
Venezuela: Problems with accessing Blogger.com
Throughout August, Venezuelan bloggers have been complaining about the difficulties of accessing Blogger.com services. A discussion has been opened on Google support forums, according to which, the routes made by users are giving different types of response, the most common being "Destination host unreachable".
According to users, the problems are intermittent and are preventing them from accessing their own desktops and blogs.
Also, they have said that it is possible to access Blogger using Google's alternative DNS when the problem arises.
However, the problem had never lasted as long and had not caught the attention of the mass media.
A few days ago, one of the main Venezuelan newspapers, Últimas Noticias, reported:
And there is no one to answer or possible reasons for this situation...!!!
Zimbabwe: Changing young lives through theatre
There's always something to learn from Shakespeare, and if I can encourage these young people to master these texts at an early age, they could go anywhere they want.
This is one of the reasons I do this.
I teach in some schools in the city and the response has been good.

Peru: The state of Quechua on the Internet
Quechua, or Runa Simi, is one of the original languages of Peru, and is thought to have emerged in the middle of the first millennium of our era.
Currently "It is spoken by between 8 and 10 million people and is the most widespread language family in Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador after Indo-European.1" according to Wikipedia.
Peruvians use more words in Quechua than we think.
India: Outrage over bomb blast outside Delhi High Court
At least nine people were reported killed and more than 45 injured in an explosion outside the Supreme Court in Delhi on the morning of Wednesday, September 7.

I'm so sorry about that.
This time in the Supreme Court itself.
Lebanon: Empowering migrant workers in languages
A community of enthusiastic young Beirut, Migrant Workers Force, are working to support foreign domestic workers in Lebanon, whose lives and working conditions are often quite unfair.
The volunteer group has only been active since January 2011 but has already managed to attract attention from both the local and international press for its innovative approach to changing perceptions of workers and employers.
Among its main achievements are the free language courses it offers, every Sunday, to workers to learn Arabic, English or French.
Eighty percent of migrant domestic workers cannot leave their employer's home.
Their situation and rights are almost universally ignored.
Initially, the Workforce consisted of only Alex, Lioba, Farah, Ali and Janie and a few other members, but recently the group has expanded.
According to Janie Shen, 24, one of the group's co-founders (the only foreign woman still in Lebanon) the idea for the Migrant Workers Force was born after newcomers like her and Alex were shocked by the conditions of migrant workers in the country - for example, degrading uniforms, mistreatment in general, having their passports confiscated, food rationed and only one or no rest day a week.
In this video Janie explains a little more about what the Migrant Workers Force is:
The Migrant Workers Force has no official office or organization but meets regularly at the Zico house in Hamra and will soon be re-established, for some of its activities, at the migrant house in Nabaa.
'Go to a poor man, but he is a source of well-being.'
Among his best campaigns are his anti-racism poster of International Labour Day (with the collaboration of three language students), a series of interviews with migrants about their conditions and some short satirical films in response to an official campaign showing Lebanon as a tourist paradise.
They have also organized celebrations with local migrants, such as the Nepalese New Year celebration and helped sell food from Africa and Asia as well as products from other migrant countries.
Language classes
On Sundays, workers from Nepal, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Sudan, get together to learn languages with volunteer teachers who want to help them.
They started as informal meetings but are now organized into more structured language classes.
A teacher says, "I offer my English skills to allow you to talk about your rights".
Language classes have become an important place for community building.
In less than two years the Migrant Workers Force has mobilized more volunteers and the goodwill of many other more established organizations.
Through language and communication, they have helped migrant domestic workers in Lebanon who face a very local problem to gain much deserved international attention.
Iran: Blogger receives 50 lashes
These are the words Iranian blogger Somayeh Tohidloo wrote on her blog after receiving 50 lashes in Evin Prison on September 14, 2011:

Tunisian police beat blogger for telling a joke
This post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Uprising 2011.
Eight months after the fall of the Ben Ali regime, the Tunisian police have not renounced their brutality and human rights violations.
On Wednesday, Tunisian blogger Azyz Amamy (@Azyyoz), was arrested and beaten by police for saying a banana joke near the police station.
He was released the same day.
In fact, last week, the acting Prime Minister Beji Caid Sebsi addressed the nation.
During his speech, he said that "97 percent of the National Guard agents are good, the rest are monkeys".
This is Azyz Amami's Twitter account.
This could explain why the police reacted so brutally to Amamy's joke.

Yemen: A massacre broadcast live
This post is part of our special coverage Yemen Protests 2011.
A massacre was witnessed live, tweet after tweet, in Yemen's capital, Sana'a. Yemeni security forces opened fire on protesters, killing at least 22 and injuring hundreds so far. The horror was being broadcast live, watched around the world by hundreds of surprised onlookers.
It's brutal to watch, as many have revealed.

The online activism reports:
The following is a list of notable bloggers:
After the interview with Yaya Coulibaly, Rising Voices wants to introduce you to Oumar Dembelé, a primary school teacher at Zambougou Public School in Cinzana-Gare, which is in the Ségou region of Mali.
In addition, Oumar participates in Ségou Villages Connection, one of the projects supported by RV, which began in 2011.
As a teacher, Oumar has the advantage of being used to communicating with students and their families and, when communicating with other people, in this case villagers, he uses those communication skills.
Oumar collects the stories of these people and sends them via SMS to Boukary Konaté, the project manager, who then publishes them on the Ségou Infos blog.
As for his activities, Oumar enjoys playing sports and reading, in addition to working and training in the technology area.
In this email interview, Oumar, who tweets as @D1Oumar, talks about his aspirations, the journey he is embarking on with this project and the positive impact the training courses are having.
Rising Voices: Tell us about your involvement in the Ségou Villages project.
Why did you join him and what is your mission within the project?
Oumar Dembélé - Representative of the people of Ségou in Zambougo
Oumar Dembélé: I joined the team thanks to Mr. Boukary Konaté (@Fasokan), whom I met when I was traveling in Cinzana-Gare.
He suggested that I participate in this project, which involves sending information via SMS; then we continued with the course we were doing on the Internet in the city of Dioro.
I found the project interesting because I realized that people really didn't talk much about what was happening in rural towns.
RV: How do you get the information together?
Do people cooperate when sharing information?
OD: At the moment, connecting with people is not a problem for me, because as an educator, I know how to get close to people.
RV: You're a teacher.
Do you think that the courses you have taken can help you in your profession and to what extent?
Do you think that your workmates and students can also benefit from your newfound knowledge?
OD: Obviously, I ask myself the same question often.
RV: The Segou Infos blog was born out of the lack of contact or communication that existed in Mali, especially between the cities (especially in the capital, Bamako) and rural communities in the country.
The aim of this project is to connect the rural world to the present and to achieve equal consideration at all levels.
If all participants do their job 100%, Ségou Infos will get a much greater spread.
RV: Could you describe what life is like in the Ségou region?
OD: Ségou is a historic city that has great heroes like Binton Coulibali, NGolo Diarra, Da Monzon Diarra, etc. The population is made up of the Bambara, De Bozo, Sarakolé, Peulh and other ethnic groups.
The activities involved are agriculture, livestock, fisheries and trade; agriculture is undoubtedly the most important and developed of all of them.

RV: Would you like to add something else to Rising Voices readers around the world?
OD: First of all, I want to send a greeting to Boukary Konaté, who was the one who suggested me to join this initiative.
I also invite Global Voices readers to visit Ségou to learn and learn about things that are not usually talked about.
Thank you, everybody.

Cameroon: What if we don't vote on October 9?
The October 9 presidential election in Cameroon, seems not to generate much interest among people.
Although his candidacy for his own re-election has not been a surprise, it has nonetheless caused quite a stir in public opinion.
This view is supported by the fact that among the 21 candidates selected by the Electoral Council, none of them really stands out, as this blogger expresses:
Arab bloggers gather in Tunisia
The Third Arab Bloggers Meeting began in Tunisia on Monday, October 3, with a one-day public conference.
The meeting is co-organized by Global Voices, Nawaat and the Heinrich Böll Foundation and attended by nearly 100 bloggers from almost all Arab countries.
Naturally, the conference was well blogged, not only on the official blog of Arab Bloggers, but also by many participants.
Here are links to media and blog coverage (please in the comments section tell us what we left out).
A report on the meeting in Al Jazeera proclaimed: "Arab bloggers say the Arab Spring has become global".
The English-language blog coverage included posts by Jillian York on Day 1, Part 1 and a special panel that included Tunisian bloggers who are now participating in Tunisian politics in many ways.
The headline news came from a groundbreaking talk by the new president of the Tunisian Internet Agency, where he revealed that Tunisia secretly tested censorship software for Western companies.

Photo by Mohamed Alâa Guedich (used with permission) The meeting continues in smaller workshops, for guests only, which will take place over the next three days.
Participants continue to tweet about the topics to be discussed in many languages using the hashtag #AB11, and the conference blog will continue to post updates.
So be careful.
Many bloggers believe that the Second Arab Blogger Meeting, held in Beirut in 2009, played an important role in building personal ties and trust among bloggers across the region - ties that allowed them to coordinate more easily during the Arab Spring.
Myanmar: President suspends dam project
Construction of the controversial dam project on the Ayeyarwaddy River in northern Myanmar has been suspended by the government.
President Thein Sein sent a letter to Parliament, informing them that the dam project will be postponed for the sake of public interest.
The project is one of China's infrastructure investments in Myanmar.
The plan was to export the power generated at this plant to China.
Last month, Electricity Minister Zaw Min told reporters that the government would not suspend the project despite concerns expressed by some groups.
But public activities, such as signing a petition, workshops and community seminars demanding the government stop the dam construction have intensified in recent weeks.
Even media organizations echoed the public, including well-known personalities, who asked the president to cancel the project.

Zambia: Netizens start countdown to promise of change in 90 days
In the last three elections he has contested, Zambia's new president, Michael Sata, has promised to transform the country in 90 days, including a promise to put more money in people's pockets.
Now that he has finally been elected as head of state, expectant netizens have started the countdown.
Some of Sata's Facebook followers are convinced that the countdown has started on a positive note, while others say that expecting any significant transformation in 90 days is unrealistic.
In other news, a group called '90 Day Agenda' has started a Facebook page to lobby.
Zambians try to get a glimpse of the new president at the inauguration ceremony in September 2011.

Sunday, October 16th is election day in Bolivia.
However, this election is different from the previous ones.
The absence of posters, painted walls and public gatherings that are typical of Bolivian elections is highlighted.
What's also different about this election is that it won't determine a president, members of Congress or local mayors.
For the first time in Bolivia, as well as in Latin America, the electors will choose 56 judges and magistrates of the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, the Council of the Judiciary and the Agricultural/Environmental Court.
These elections have been guaranteed by the new Constitution with the idea of eliminating the direct nomination of judges by the political party holding the majority in Congress, as was done previously.Although there was a process to allow objections to certain candidates who could not prove affiliation to a political party, many citizens believe that the ruling Movement to Socialism (MAS) party will end up benefiting from the results.
Some of those feelings come from a statement by Bolivian President Evo Morales, in August 2011 at an event in Tolata, who said "I am sure sisters and brothers in this Judicial Body election again we will win with 60, 70 percent with 90, 100 percent in the peasant communities".
There have been some reports of irregularities in the selection process, as well as questioning the impartiality of the President of the Supreme Electoral Court, Wilfredo Ovando, who was discovered to have strong ties to MAS in his recent campaign during Morales' reelection.
Twitter user Gastón (@gastulas) is skeptical about the independence of the candidates and tweets:

Using citizen media to promote underrepresented languages
Join New Tactics, Rising Voices, Indigenous Tweets and other professionals in an online discussion on using citizen media tools to promote underrepresented languages*, from November 16-22, 2011.
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) regularly publishes an Atlas that documents and locates more than 2,500 global languages classified as vulnerable, endangered or extinct.
UNESCO also estimates that of the 6,000 languages spoken today, more than half will be extinct by the start of the next century, adding that:
Bolivia: President says road will not pass through TIPNIS
Dario Kenner reports from La Paz: "In a press conference on the morning of Friday 21, President Evo Morales said that the road project that his government is determined to build will not cross the TIPNIS national park and indigenous territory.
This is a dramatic change in policy.
It comes after a month of marches by indigenous movements against the planned road and they arrived in La Paz two days ago".
Tunisia: It is election day!

Russia: Explain the success of the National Freestyle System
Russian wrestlers are usually considered the best in the world.
Mr. Karelin was an elite Russian wrestler and Olympic champion and is now an elected official who works in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian Duma.

In a blog post last year, he discussed why the Russian team is so effective:
Languages: Let's tweet and talk in Quechua
Imagine that you have always wanted to learn Quechua, an indigenous language spoken in the Andean region of South America, but have never had time to attend classes properly.
Now, a new project called Let's Talk Quechua has developed a way to offer daily lessons through a series of automated tweets that help the interested learner build a vocabulary.
The team includes Kiko Mayorga, developer Mariano Crowe and Irma Álvarez Ccoscco, a Quechua poet and translator from the organization Runasimipi.
The result of this collaboration is the Twitter account (@hablemosquechua), which currently has almost 1700 followers.
The program is created from a database of Spanish words and their Quechua equivalents to provide term pairs:
He also tweets little questions asking followers to recall previous lessons:
The Quechua language has numerous dialects and varies from region to region, producing variations in lexicon and spelling.
This is something that the project has fully acknowledged, and they apologize for choosing Quechua spoken in the Cusco-Collao region of Peru as the dialect for the program.
This is the main reason why the tweets use the expression "the Quechua word for 'flower' could be 't'ika,' a way of acknowledging that there could be other words for flower.
They hope to account for these differences between regional dialects, as well as make the account much more interactive and responsive to feedback from their followers.
The program could also be used by other language communities that would like to use Twitter as a way to provide short, quick vocabulary lessons to underrepresented language learners.

Global Voices Podcast: Bridging the language gap
This post is part of our special coverage on Languages and the Internet.
Hello world! What's going on?
In this Global Voices Podcast, we discuss the languages that are hard to find on the Internet.
Do you speak a language that's hard to find on the Internet?
Do you live in a place where your mother tongue is not widely spoken?
Then you are part of a large number of people in the world who speak and write "under-represented languages".
We also look forward to Project 11 Eleven on 11/11/11.
New dialogue for the preservation of languages on the Internet
The good news is that here at Global Voices, we are looking for new ways for people to use citizen media to strengthen and enjoy indigenous and underrepresented languages.
Eddie Avila is the director of the Global Voices project, Rising Voices.
He told me how he came to explore this issue and how he is working with New Tactics for Human Rights and others to continue the discussion.
In our interview, Eddie mentions the amazing work of Kevin Scannell.
Kevin is a professor of mathematics and computer science at St. John's University.
He told us how he got into the field of mapping indigenous tweets and micro-blogs around the world.
Using phones to solve language challenge in India
Using a mobile phone to access the web in a language that is underrepresented is still not easy.
But the Internet is full of people willing to take on those challenges to make our digital world a more inclusive place.
One of our Global Voices authors Aparna Ray directed me to Shubhranshu Choudhary who works at CG Net Swara, a community radio station based on mobile phones in India.
He explained to me how this service helps people who communicate in the less represented languages.
A podcast in Quechua
There are many really interesting initiatives on the Internet that can help us explore underrepresented languages online.
Christine Mladic is the program administrator at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University and participates in a series of podcasts called Rimasun that seek to highlight and make use of the Quechua language.
A day to remember
Since this is the November edition of Global Voices podcast, it means we are close to the date, 11/11/11.
This is a special day for those who are participating in Project 11 Eleven.
Danielle Lauren is the creative director and she explained to us what's about to happen and how we can all participate.
Some of the people Danielle mentions are Global Voices writers, and Eleven Eleven project ambassadors, so I asked Salman Latif from Pakistan and Lalatiana Rahariniaina from Madagascar to share their expectations for that day.
We're also in...
That's all we could cover this time in the podcast.

These days Buddhist monks have come out to fight the advancing floods.
The water seems to be confined to the main street, and so far the flow does not seem to be so great as to advance much further over the city; but, once this is cleared, it can be observed that some of the surrounding minor streets have been completely under water.
Twitter user @ThanongK criticizes the government's efforts to mitigate the situation: @ThanongK: Only middle class people with internet access get information about floods.

Tunisia: Police violently disperse anti-capitalism protesters
This article is part of our special coverage Tunisian uprising 2010/11.
Inspired by the Occupy movements taking place around the world, mainly Occupy Wall Street, and under the umbrella of the global Occupy the World event on 11.11.11, hundreds of protesters took to the streets towards #occupytunis displaying their anti-capitalism slogans.
#OccupyTunis took place in the Human Rights Square, an avenue in the center of the capital crowded with financial institutions and banks.
The following YouTube video shows protesters marching through central Tunisia before reaching the square where they would later gather, while chanting "the people want the debt to end", alluding to Tunisia's debts, "the people want the fall of Wall Street" and "jobs, freedom and no debt".

China: Photo captures the situation of 58 million 'left behind children'
A photo showing a little girl holding her baby brother in a classroom caused a stir in Chinese cyberspace last month.
This reflects the long-standing social problem of children being 'left behind' in rural villages by their parents.
The discussion has been "harmonized" on online platforms under the term "My little brother wants to sleep" (弟弟要睡了) which has been leaked and is now no longer found on major search engines like Sina, Baidu and Sohu since November 7, 2011 as the discussion was becoming increasingly political.
It is estimated that there are about 58 million abandoned children in China.
My little brother wants to sleep.
The 10-year-old girl in the photo is named Long Zhanghuang, her two-year-old brother is named Zhang Junjie.
Her parents are migrant rural workers who work in the city while her children live with their grandparents.
The classroom is located in a village in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province.

Cuba: "bloggers" discuss Internet "offline" on Radio Marti
On September 22, 2011, Radio Martí host Karen Caballero presided over a debate between blogger and anthropologist Ted Henken of the University of the City of New York (CUNY) and several Cuban "bloggers", including: Yoani Sánchez, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo and several Henken students.
This was a special event for Radio Marti.
This radio and television network is funded and overseen by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the U.S. federal agency responsible for directing radio and television broadcasts in countries where government-independent media are scarce or heavily censored.
Most of Radio Marti's programming is clearly anti-Castro and supportive of US policy in Cuba; most of its audience sees it as a symbol of the political paralysis that the US and Cuba have suffered for decades.
But this particular program focused on a group of Cubans: "bloggers", who do not define themselves as either dissidents or advocates of the fall of the Cuban government.
The participants discussed the increasing visibility of bloggers and social media in Cuba, and the particular way these new media are used on the island, where the penetration rate of Internet and mobile phones is extremely low.
Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo, a photographer for the blog Boring Home Utopics, described the "offline" Internet as something that had been shaped by the Cuban media:
This is the Internet offline , the Internet without Internet ... blogs circulate through the internal e-mails of Cuba ... blogs circulate offline discs, on CDs, flash memory, DVDs, and therefore information is passed from one hand to another ...
Sánchez described his Blogger Academy as a place where he teaches friends and acquaintances how to use the tools of recent media as they are really new to most Cubans.
She described: Make the most of your mobile , as a workshop where she teaches participants how to "post" photos, videos and "tweet" via SMS.
I'd prefer the next-door neighbor... but the Internet wasn't a choice.
The Internet was the only option.
We came to the conclusion that we were never going to get a minute on the radio, a minute on television, not even a line in the national press.
So we had to use the Internet as the only form of civic expression.
Of course, the Internet is far from a "perfect" form of expression and information exchange.
For many Cubans, the Internet is still an unknown place and the simple concept of a blog or Twitter account is difficult for them to understand.
But for those Cubans who can have Internet or for those who participate in the Internet "offline" blogs and social networks have opened up a space for communication and expression completely independent of the government.
This is novel and something very powerful, and while its social effects may be small and gradual, some bloggers believe that things are starting to change thanks to technology on the island.
The Cuban poet and essayist Antonio José Ponte, who also participated in the conversation, supported this idea.
The information is now much more visible. People are now much less afraid of being informed.
All that fear is being relegated to the background by new methods of communication.
* While this radio program allowed listeners to learn more about the particular stance of new media in Cuba, the broadcast represented a rare encounter with the general media landscape in Cuba.
The second post will feature an interview with Ted Henken, who will share his experience working with Radio Marti, a US government-funded station.

Zambia: Porn video sparks debate on gender, culture and morals
Recently a video of a young student from one of Zambia's most expensive schools, the Zambian Accounting Center (ZCAS), having sex with her boyfriend, surfaced on a hardcore porn site (we did not publish the link or name) and went viral among Zambian netizens who freely shared the link.
Zambia is a culturally conservative Christian nation where such a video is considered immoral and also illegal under Chapter 87 of the Zambia Penal Code Act, which makes it a crime to create or distribute obscene material.
Violators can face up to five years in prison if found guilty.
The comments, which number in the hundreds and even thousands if you count those appearing on different online platforms, are varied.
@lwangamwilu I really think it's unfair for society to treat her like this, where are the women's groups: WfC (Women for Change, an open NGO for gender)?
If you've never filmed yourself with your girlfriend, I imagine you're still living in the '20s when it was hard to find a camera.
Don't make this look any more than it is.
They're not "actors" and no money was exchanged.

Iran: British embassy in Tehran attacked
British Embassy
On November 29, a crowd of about a thousand demonstrated near the British Embassy in Tehran after Britain cut all financial ties with Iran over doubts about its nuclear program.
The meeting was peaceful, before some protesters stormed the building.
This incident reminded many observers of the 1979 attack on the US embassy in Tehran.
A few days earlier, the Iranian parliament voted to expel the British ambassador because relations have deteriorated.
This is a video of the demonstration:
Xcalibur, an Iranian blogger, advises people not to follow the official line of calling the attackers "students".
The blogger says:
January: Extra, extra, read it all!
As the culmination of a seven-week program in which young residents of the Brazilian municipality of Januária learned to ask questions about the way local government operates in the city, as well as reflect those questions in blog posts, citizen journalists from the Rising Voices-funded project Amigos de Januária recently published a special edition newspaper titled "Folha do Norte".
This paper complements the continuous work done by citizen journalists, who have been publishing a series of reports that analyze those local problems that affect all residents.
In addition to publishing articles online, the newspaper, both in electronic and printed formats, gives them the opportunity to reach those inhabitants who do not have an Internet connection.The newspaper, free and available at various points in the municipality of Januária, provides articles reporting on local issues, from health care to infrastructure and education projects, as well as the role of culture in the place.
Download the paper here:
Over the course of the next few weeks we will be translating some excerpts from articles published in the "Folha do Norte" into English.
Peru: Cybernetics denounce police repression during protests in Lima against mining Conga
Several Peruvian netizens denounced police repression during a protest held on December 5 in Lima, against the Conga mining project in Cajamarca.
Juan Arellano links to several citizen media reports, including blog articles, photos and videos.
Venezuela: Wave of expropriations on Twitter
For months, social media in Venezuela and mainstream media have denounced a wave of expropriations of Twitter accounts of outspoken critics of the government.
From one moment to the next, followers of these accounts were surprised to see that many of the figures who had previously spoken out against the government were posting messages of unconditional support for the Bolivarian Revolution, or were confessing to being supporters and admirers of President Hugo Chávez.
The wave of identity theft, or "hacking" as it has been called, has reached the accounts of artists, politicians, journalists, writers and academics who openly criticize the government's moves.
Two months ago, the N33 group issued a statement (available on Taringa) and took responsibility for the online expropriations made during that period.
Apparently not, because N33 considers them a "pro-imperialist" group and what they are looking for is to bring justice for the atrocities committed against President Chávez and his government on Twitter
Only in my Bello Pais! #venezuela good for Luis! !@laureanomar: To inform you that @luisvicenteleon hacked the hacker and recovered his account...
Finally, Luis Carlos Díaz, in his post The Hacker's Bill, comments and reflects:
The result is that crime increases and official silence continues.
Do you remember that?
Egypt: Remembering Khaled Said for a "World without Torture"
The International Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture (IRCT) recently released a 15-minute film entitled World Without Torture, which focuses on the importance of preventing torture and also on the importance of documenting it and providing rehabilitation to torture survivors.
Elizabeth Rivera, writer and translator for Global Voices
Elizabeth Rivera arrived this year and has since translated for Global Voices in Spanish, written her own articles for both Global Voices in Spanish and Global Voices Online and also translated for Global Voices in English.
The end result is this little interview I'm sharing with you today.
Hello, Elizabeth, tell us about yourself, where you're from, where you are, what you do?
Hey, there!
I am a citizen of the world who by chance and fortune was born in Mexico D.F. a little over 30 years ago.
I've lived in six cities in three countries and I hope to be lucky enough to be able to increase that number.
Today I am in Santiago, Chile and in my daily life - in addition to collaborating with Global Voices - I earn my living as a marketing professional.
How did you hear about Global Voices and get involved in their work?
With the birth of the Arab Spring, I reactivated my Twitter account.
I started following interesting people who posted regularly, including @JustAmira.
I was struck by the Twitbon he had on his profile and that's how I got to Global Voices.
I immediately fell in love with the site when I read the posts and the reason for it, and I saw the link to help as a translator and I said, "I'm from here".
The same day you contacted me, the rest is history.
Now I not only translate but I have the opportunity to write my own pieces.
I feel very proud to be a part of this community and I hope to continue to be for a long time.
I've learned a lot and met some very valuable people.
Elizabeth Rivera with her little girl.
It's 2011.
How do you find time to translate and write?
A little discipline is all.
When I take a translation, I set a deadline for delivery.
When I'm writing a post, I don't take translations.
Anyway, I type fast on the keyboard and I'm used to doing a lot of things at the same time (you know, work, being a mom, husband, writing, friends, etc, etc.):)
You said you lived in six different cities, tell us about your travels!
Now that I think of it, it's seven!
In Mexico I have lived in the D.F., Cuernavaca, San Cristóbal de las Casas and Cancun.
In the United States, I lived in Irvine and Chino, both cities in California.
In Chile, only in Santiago.
Mexico City is the city where I was born and where I have my roots, my people, my identity.
It is a community, in the middle of the Zapatista zone, very poor in material terms, but tremendously rich in culture.
It's been one of the most enriching and profound experiences I've ever had in my life.
Elizabeth Rivera in Dublin, Ireland. She was born in Dublin, Ireland.
Changing topics, how do you see the Chilean student movement? will the negotiations between them and the government get anywhere?
The 2011 Chilean student movement is the second part of the "penguin revolution" of 2006.
Education is the foundation of any society.
It's not just a problem of universities, it's about "getting in the hood" from kindergarten.
It seems to me that if Chile wants to continue growing and aspires to be a developed and inclusive nation, it must have an education system that accompanies these goals.
This must be what prevails at the tables.
The youth have already lit the flame of change, now it is up to the current government to seize the golden opportunity it has in front of it to leave a positive mark on Chile's history.
And what do you think is the reason why the government doesn't want to compromise at the core of its educational model?
Both personal and ideological.
Others are "afraid" of getting their hands on tax laws or think that reform would be too complicated and/or expensive.
The status quo is easier and more comfortable.
Finally, at least this time, the protests have managed to take the discussion to deeper issues and have not lost the level of pressure, which is already a gain over the previous movement.
How do you assess the use and impact of new media in the student movement?
New media have been key to elevating the discussion and including all citizens at this table.
Anyone can have an opinion, debate, propose.
That's always good for a democracy.
Even at the beginning of this movement, they didn't even cover the protests giving any news while there were thousands of people on the streets protesting.
Elizabeth Rivera in Angelmó, Puerto Montt, Chile, in the year 2010.
Why are you volunteering at Global Voices and not another NGO?
For me, connectivity in all senses is important.
It's the reason I chose my career and why I like to travel.
Global Voices has allowed me and allows readers to understand cultures, ways of thinking and news from other perspectives, which is extremely enriching as it makes ties grow closer and borders - starting with language - disappear.
It's normal for my husband, my daughter and I to pack on a Friday and come back on Sunday without any major problems.
I also like to read, mainly historical novels, although since my little girl was born I have not had much time to devote to reading.
I like to play with her and show her new things, see how she learns.
And just so you can see how sure you can be, our Regional Editor Silvia Viñas, jumped in to find her and talked briefly, which I remember from this short video:
And please follow Elizabeth on Twitter: @elimaguire.

Colombia: Christmas for the children of 'La Casa del Colibri'

Ukraine: Public hospital pioneers in social media use
Founded in 1798, the Dniopropetrovsk regional hospital  named after Ilya Ilych Mechnikov- is one of the oldest hospitals in Ukraine.
It is also one of the first medical institutions to use social media.
The person behind the creation of the Twitter (@MechnikovaBoln) and Facebook accounts of the country's first public hospital, is the tech-savvy epidemiologist and blogger, Mykhailo Sukholym (@mvsnotes, mvsnotes.blogspot.com).
However, this is not the first time a social media account has been created for a state medical institution.
Social media enthusiasts
Sukhomlyn and his wife  the programmer Tetyana Cheshko (@tvnotes) - used to work in the state health epidemiology department.
Both are social media fans, and they created the institution's Twitter account, which was initially only used for internal information exchange between department staff.
Mykhailo and Tetyana confirmed that they were frequently contacted by Twitter users with questions about health and medicine.
After becoming the head of the information office at Dnipropetrovsk Regional Hospital, Sukhomlyn decided to build on her successful experience there and launched social media accounts to share news about the hospital, including events, job openings, the arrival of new equipment, etc.
Mykhailo Sukhomlyn (first from right) and Tetyana Cheshko (third from right) with medical information systems specialists, photo from Dnipropetrovsk Regional Hospital
In an interview with Channel 9 Dnipropetrovsk TV, Sukhomlyn said the hospital's Twitter account is used to publicize the services provided by the institution, while Facebook users are encouraged to use this platform to discuss the quality of the services.
For example, one of the first problems patients raised was the long queues at the hospital.
Other medical staff at the facility are also using Twitter.
Last month, the hospital shared its list of followers to encourage others to repeat the action:
Slovakia: The most expensive Apple computers
The University of Economics in Bratislava (EUBA) has just signed a contract to acquire electronic systems and software for its Faculty of National Economy for a price of up to 1.8 million euros.
Many of these products are overvalued (you can see the contract here).
For example, a MacBook would cost the university about 9000 euros even though it is not a latest model (to be more precise, the price of "9000 euros for a MacBook" also includes a 24-inch Apple LCD screen, an external keyboard and a mouse).
However, normally the total would be around EUR 3000, plus an extended service contract.
According to media reports, the university does not believe there is any anomaly and explains that the prices are the result of a public tender, which is won by the lowest bidder.
The supplier that won the contest, Gratex International, stated that there were products that were not making a profit so they decided that other products would be making a profit.
It's the opposite!

Chile: Neighbors and netizens unite to save Concón Dunes
Since the company Reñaca Concón S.A. began the efforts to build a real estate complex in the delicate and unique ecosystem of the Dunes of Concón, the struggle of the neighbors to prevent development began.
On December 27, 2011, his nightmare came true: the construction company began to erect a fence around the protected area.
But this time they were not alone, the Chilean cyberspace was filled with protests against this closure and the construction of up to 20 luxury apartment buildings in the sector, thus accompanying the complaints of the 50 neighbors who demonstrated at the place.
The Twitter user @Perro_del_Lucho warned:
The world speaks... we translate
The end of the year is usually a time for evaluating what has been achieved during the year that is about to end.
Sometimes it seeks to be very objective and other subjectivities of who does it come to the surface, however most of the time, these balances, reviews and lists of the best of the year do not satisfy everyone.
At Global Voices Spanish, some members of the translators team who spent the last 12 months behind the scenes to bring you the best of what Global Voices Online publishes daily, were imbued with this spirit and decided to briefly talk about what they liked most about translating or what impacted them most about what we saw published.
And as they say in my country, let's leave the "flower" and get to the point:
Gabriela García Calderón tells us how she unknowingly put her little bit of sand into spreading a movement with then unknown consequences:
Global Voices Podcast: 2012, happy new year
All links are in English except those specified in another language
In this podcast we will review 2011; we will see the differences and similarities between mainstream news and new journalism and also talk about a Rising Voices meeting in Bolivia to support the development of an ethnically and socially diverse blogosphere.
And we'll go on a road trip on the internet on two wheels!
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not received any comments from interested parties.
For journalists, bloggers and commentators around the world, 2011 has been an unusual year.
It is hard to imagine a time in the past when our friends and collaborators were threatened, arrested or abused on such a scale.
Nor was there a year in which we witnessed such influence by citizen media on the Internet.
For many of our writers and friends at Global Voices, times are still tough, but let us have faith that better times are coming.
Looking back, the year of Global Voices has been quite an achievement.
Our associate editor, Emma Brewin, talks about jumping into the hectic tide of global news and about the stories that have impacted her most in this busy year.
From mainstream to new media
Global Voices' regional teams are made up of writers, bloggers and editors of many kinds.
Some, like Thiana Bondo, a Global Voices author and translator from Bahia, Brazil, come from journalism.
Our editor-in-chief, Solana Larsen, spoke to Thiana, who is currently in London, about the differences between being a correspondent for a newspaper in use in Brazil and writing for Global Voices.
In support of indigenous web pages in Bolivia
In December, Rising Voices hosted a three-day event in Cochabamba, Bolivia for Bolivian bloggers.
The goal was to support the development of a more weighty and diverse blogosphere.
Workshops and presentations of technical tools and organizational strategies were held.
The meeting was in Spanish and was called Conectándonos.
María Mercado is a student and volunteer who works with indigenous communities.
He attended the meeting and tells us what he learned.
If you want to hear more, there is a fantastic podcast covering the entire Rising Voices meeting, produced by our Executive Director Georgia Poppellwell and Rising Voices Director Eduardo Avila.
Come on your bikes with us!
You may think that distance separates us and only the Internet unites us, but it turns out we also have some healthy habits in common.
Always prepared with her recorder, Solana Larsen talks about the wonders of cycling with Global Voices Executive Director Ivan Sigal.
As Ivan says, the online cycling community is amazing.
Naturally, I was forced to ask our bicycle and audio geniuses to share their ideas with us about two wheels.
Cyrus Farivar, an American journalist now living in Germany and author of "The Internet of Elsewhere", spoke to us about cycling - directly from the saddle of his bicycle.
In Denmark, Maria Grabowski Kjaer shared the sounds of the city where cycling is a party.
Anyway, that's it for our first podcast of the year.
We'll be here in 2012, sharing and talking about the world's customs and news so tune in and above all decide what you'd like to hear.
I'll leave you for now, inspired by our two-wheeled stars I'm going to see if I can learn to ride my bike without being a danger to myself and those around me!

Singing the national anthem in their own language
If you watched the 2011 Rugby World Cup, you may have noticed some of the players from the host country, New Zealand, and their fans, singing their national anthem in two languages. It was not until 1999, in a match against England, that one of the two official national anthems, "God Save New Zealand", was performed in a new format with the first verse sung in Māori and the second verse in English.
Both are official languages of New Zealand, but English is the most widely spoken and understood.
Even so, the history of the Maori language dates back to at least the 13th century, long before the arrival of the colonists.
However, the passion for the sport of rugby, of which New Zealand is the current world champion, has led many more citizens to take an active interest in learning the lyrics of the anthem.
Video from a 2005 game:
According to Ashley Mackenzie-White of the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, thousands have been visiting the ministry's website to listen to or study the words of the bilingual anthem.
Karaitiana Taiuru, Māori language and technology activist, provides the lyrics of the anthem on her blog:

Will Iran soon have its "clean internet"?
The Iranian regime may be losing its battle to filter content on the internet, but in the meantime it is trying new things - from slowing down the network, to developing a so-called "national internet" or "clean internet" (read Intranet).
Iranian members of parliament have also discussed a proposal to place blogs, comments and SMS messages under the same government regulation as mass media.
The Iranian authorities see the internet as a real battlefield and consider citizen media and social media as tools of "soft war".
For several years they have claimed to have blocked and filtered millions of websites and blogs.
Now several bloggers have reported that Iran's Corporate Computer Systems says the goal for Iran is to become completely disconnected from the global network once the country launches its own national internet.
Mehdi Jafari thanks to the Green Voice of Freedom
In October, many bloggers were happy to quote a senior official who said, "Filtering is useless".
Mehdi Jafari, identified as the technology director of the Basij Student Organization (youth paramilitaries in support of the Islamic regime), claimed that 17 million Iranians are on Facebook even though the site has been leaked in Iran... and that "the 300,000 websites of the Persian League are fighting against our religious and national beliefs".
Donayeh Eghtesad, an Iranian newspaper, wrote in 2010:
Two years earlier, Hamshari, an Iranian news website, wrote that "national internet" is an ambiguous term.
They quote a media expert who says that if this project is about 100% filtering and exclusion from the international internet, it is neither useful nor operational.
So, whose national internet is it?
According to Hamshari, the Iranian parliament refused to give an initial $10 million five years ago, forcing the government to seek other funding.
And if the idea of the "national internet" wasn't ambiguous enough, Iran's Minister of Communications, Reza Taghipour, has introduced another term: "clean internet".
He said they wanted to shield the internet from dirty deeds and protect human beings.
He said that originally, the Internet was created for peaceful purposes, but now there are stains on it.
He explains the difference between a filtering system and this idea of a clean internet.
For the first there is a blacklist (filtered sites), but for the second there will only be a white list (limiting the internet to allowed sites).
Now that we're talking about a clean internet or even a Halal internet, we could also call it a virtual Frankenstein.
Russia: Population crisis means no one left to recruit
Russia is endowed with one of the largest natural resource reserves in the world, and yet the demographic crisis that has been ravaging the country since the fall of the Soviet Union may leave Russia without young men to defend their homeland.
Russia's total life expectancy is #161 in the world, which puts it behind Belarus, North Korea and Mongolia, while Russia's total fertility rate is #196 in the world.
Currently, there are about 138 million people in Russia and many believe that if that number falls below 100 million, Russia will not be able to function as an industrialized country.
In November 2011, the blog War News Update published an article by RIA Novosti titled "Russian Army 'no longer has anyone to recruit'":
Mexico, wake up!
Artists United for Peace
For example, singer Ely Guerra was recorded playing Marisela Escobedo, a mother who fought for justice for her daughter's death.
Although her daughter's husband confessed to killing her, authorities declared that there was insufficient evidence.
The Ambulant Project website describes the following video:
Piro Pendas (Ritmo Peligroso), Mexican musician, gives voice to the story of Leonardo, which is the story of our country.
There is no deadline for video submission as it is an ongoing project.
Names are changed by numbers and this makes us oblivious to tragedy.
Every victim has a name and behind it there's a life, a story, a family.
Carlos Avilés gives his voice to Juan Carlos Medrano.
Another 14 young people were killed and at least 20 were injured.
They were all between 15 and 20 years old.
Experiences from Global Voices Aymarata during 2011
I'm Victoria Tinta and I want to share my experience with Global Voices very briefly.
I started translating for Global Voices Aymarata in 2009, during that time I only translated one article a month, on topics such as politics, sports, education, environment and others.
But since I took over as editor, I no longer translate just one, but I am translating more than 5 articles a month.
All these translations I always do in my free time; a written post is finished in one, two, even 3 hours, depending on the extension; in addition, by translating and editing I was able to get informed about the situations that were happening in other countries.
Among the translations I did, there's a theme that stuck in my mind and it's this: Languages: Let's Tweet and talk in Quechua.
For me at that time what I was reading to translate was something interesting, and this is the translation into Aymara: Arunaka: Tuytiyañani ukatx qhichwat arsuñani.
Some of the translators from Global Voices Aymarata
Being a volunteer translator makes me really happy, and I'm so excited to keep going.
On the other hand, I congratulate the translators of Global Voices Aymarata ¡Nayraqatar sarantasipkakima!
Irma Silveria Laura Apaza writes:
The translations I did for the Global Voices Aymarata site were from June 2011, I was always interested in what is relevant to languages and I think it is very important to revalue what the Aymara language is, especially to make this Aymara language known through the Internet and to make other people interested in translations.
In all the time I personally did the translations, the one that caught my attention most was the one from Slovakia: The most expensive Apple computers and in Aymara it is: Slovakia: Apple cumputaduranakax senti jila chaniniwa.
And people don't care about that, university students have cutting-edge technology to study no matter the cost of the machines, nowadays having a computer is no longer a privilege but a necessity.
Most students have a netbook and as in all countries some teachers are behind in what technology is.
Martha Valencia Intimayata writes:
I have been a member of Global Voices Aymarata since 2010 and since then I have been translating, so I keep up with what is happening in the world.
As time went on and as I have been translating very interesting topics, among them what impressed me most was: Iran: Bloguera gets 50 lashes and this is the Aymara translation: Iran: Bloguerax phisqa tunk jawqaw katuqatäna.
What struck me is how a blogger can get 50 lashes for giving information, that seems very bad to me.
Personally, I started translating last year, in the first few months.
First of all, it is a great satisfaction to be able to contribute to the language's survival on the Internet, and particularly on Global Voices Online.
As for the translation I do for Global Voices Aymarata, I think it is for the benefit of speakers of the Aymara language, the Aymara language itself, as the status goes up considerably when it is on the Internet.
The topic that most struck me was the help humanitarian workers received during and after the earthquake rescue operations in Japan: Japan: Helping humanitarian workers and in Aymara: Japan: Japunan yanaptirinakar yanaptasa.
Emma Quispe Mamani writes:
I have been translating for Global Voices Aymara since February 2011, so I have been translating for a year now, and the most interesting thing about translations is that when you translate you get to know about very important issues that are happening in the world, and this is very important to me; but what impacted me most was the topic of: Zambia: Cyber users start countdown to the promise of change in 90 days and this is the Aymara translation: Zambia: Cibernautanakax 90 mark turkaki amtawitx urun niyaw jakhuñ qalltapxi And I continued translating because I liked translating in Aymara.
Elias Quispe Chura writes:
It all started when my colleague Ruben very warmly invited me to be part of the Jaqi Aru project.
So I didn't think twice about joining it, because at those times I was looking for opportunities to apply my knowledge learned during my university career.
Soon, I was taught how to use the tools in Global Voices Aymarata, which I found very interesting and a little complicated.
I've been doing all this because I love translating different languages.
Even more so if it is about contributing to the native language, and especially sharing it with society through the Internet.
Among them, one of the articles that caught my attention most is about Mexico: Celebrating 100 years of Cantinflas .
I chose this topic because I am a fan of the famous comedian, and I wanted to learn more about his life, his career and I learned a lot of things from translating.
To begin with, I put myself in his shoes, felt it and understood that he did not become famous overnight, but it was a whole process with virtues and sorrows.
Although there were some vocabulary limitations in Aymara compared to others, those pitfalls have been pushed to the side, and are being overcome gradually.
I would really like the writers on Global Voices to post content that doesn't exist on the site.
Well, that would give me more options to choose the topics to translate into Aymara, and not just to choose.
We must communicate with the world.
Cameroon: Motorcycle taxi drivers and citizens of Duala clash violently
On December 31, in Deido, a popular district of Duala, Cameroon's financial capital, a riot broke out between the neighbours and motorcycle taxi drivers, also known as "benskiners".
According to this article in the newspaper Le Jour and several testimonies from Cameroonian netizens, this type of altercation is frequent.
Elie Kopter explains on Facebook the reason for the riots:

Libya: Letter from a woman in Benghazi
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Libyan uprising.
A Libyan woman in Benghazi is criticizing her countrymen for marrying foreigners after the revolution.
She writes the following open letter titled "A long letter from one of the sisters in Benghazi" on Facebook:
Singapore: Ministers accept wage cuts
Singapore's government ministers are among the highest paid in the world; Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong earns more money than Barack Obama, David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy combined.
The issue of high minister salaries was a hot topic in the 2011 General Election, and after the People's Action Party (PAP) won with the fewest votes in history, Prime Minister Lee convened a committee to review minister salaries.
Unlike the general and presidential elections where efforts were made to work with new media, the press conference was not allowed to news agencies, online media and bloggers.
Bolivia: The public meeting of "Connecting Us"
The three-day event "Conecting Us" had, intentionally, a maximum capacity of 35 participants and 5 moderators.
This allowed for greater interaction and connection among those who attended.
However, we know that the issue of increasing the involvement of the Bolivian Internet sector is a topic of debate that should involve the entire community.
That is why, as part of the meeting, a public meeting was held on the afternoon of 13 December, free of charge and open to the general public.
The following is the program of the event, which featured prominent speakers, some of whom participated in the meeting and others were invited.
Presentation: The evolution of the digital high
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
Until a few years ago, the number of bloggers in El Alto, a city of over a million inhabitants, could be counted on the fingers of one hand.
Today, it is a digital city, where young people surf the Internet more than any other city in the country.
We'll hear about this story and some of the initiatives that are helping to reduce the digital divide in El Alto.
We will also hear the experiences of a veteran blogger and those who use citizen media to show the other side of the city to the rest of the country and the world.
Presentation: How to connect in Bolivia
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
We know that social media offers great opportunities for communication.
However, to reduce the digital divide and promote participation, 'real-life' connections are more important than ever.
These digital initiatives and training projects need partnerships and partnerships to ensure greater reach and success.
In this presentation, two leaders from the city of Santa Cruz will talk about their experiences in creating these connections to make things happen.
Discussion: The first steps towards a more responsive public sector
The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Guterres, has been elected by the people of the European Union.

The European Commission has launched a new initiative to promote the use of digital technologies in the European Union.

Government agencies and public institutions increasingly recognize the importance of the Internet for interacting with citizens.
The Facebook profiles and Twitter accounts of some of these entities allow for greater communication with those.
These initiatives are a great first step, but how can we reach more people, especially those in the poorest sections of society with little access to the Internet?

Discussion: Native languages in cyberspace
Moderator: Eduardo Ávila, Global Voices, and the Spanish language
The panelists included Ruben Hilare (El Alto), Victoria Tinta (El Alto), Ignacio Tomichá Chuvé (Santa Cruz) and the Spanish national team.
When you do a search on the Internet, it is very difficult to find content in these languages.
We will talk about the challenges that indigenous communities face when using these languages on the internet.
We also talk about initiatives that help promote the use of these languages on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as a way to motivate the new generations to revitalize these languages.
The following is the text of the statement by the President of the National Assembly of Bolivia, Juan Ernesto Luna Ulloa (El Alto), National Coordinator of the Bolivian Diverse Youth Network:
The LGBT community in Bolivia has had to hide in the shadows due to intolerance and discrimination from different social sectors.
For this reason, some LGBT bloggers felt the need to write anonymously. Although in some parts of the country things are slowly changing, social networking sites are a safer platform for members of this community to express themselves without the risks that exist outside the virtual world.
Africa: The 2012 Nations Cup is underway!

First day of games
Libya faced Equatorial Guinea in the opening match on 21 January, and it was co-host Equatorial Guinea, in their first match, who scored a surprise 1-0 victory.
The Senegalese failed to enter the competition with a 2-1 defeat to Zambia on the same day.
Senegal fans took to the web to blame the national team's coach.

Language tools: virtual keyboards and transliteration
Imagine you're writing in a language based on non-Latin characters and you're stranded in an internet booth at a foreign airport trying to figure out how to send an email in your language.
The PC you're probably using has a different keyboard than qwerty and there's no multilingual support in the operating system.
There are some online tools that can be very helpful.

Peru: Water March approaches Lima
The Water March, which started from Cajamarca on February 1, continues to move forward, and after getting a good reception in the La Libertad Region and more adhesions from farmers, fishermen and ecologists on its way through the Ancash Region, it is already approaching Lima.
The ancashinos made four central demands for which they joined the March: intangibility of basin headings, prohibition of mining with cyanide and mercury, right to consultation of the peoples and declaring water a constitutional right.
The Observation Mission issued its report of the day, where it identifies certain problems related to the march that we had already mentioned in previous posts:
Meanwhile in Lima the march supporters are preparing to receive them on Thursday, February 9.
The blog Gran Marcha Nacional de Agua posts the routes of the march in Lima, and Seamos un río posts asking for donations:
A look at Rising Voices' microfinance proposals
From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, Rising Voices has received 1,175 submissions from 124 countries around the world.
This increase in the number of applications, compared to last year, demonstrates the growing interest and need to bring citizen media to underrepresented communities.
While we were reviewing these projects, we thought our readers might be interested in some of the initial data from this call.
Two East African nations, Uganda and Kenya, top the list of countries with the highest number of applications.
For a more concrete idea of how other countries are represented in terms of applications, look at the word cloud created by the Wordle site.
The size of the country name is proportional to the number of applications received from that country.
Word Cloud of Representation by Country - Click to enlarge the image.
Ninety-five percent of the applicants were submitting a proposal for the first time, meaning that the remaining five percent had participated in previous Rising Voices microfinance calls, which began in 2007.
We asked applicants to describe in detail the objectives of their project, and Education, Women, Gender, Indigenous Communities, and Development were the most mentioned categories.
The term word cloud of the projects - Click to enlarge
These are just a few demographic details gathered from a preliminary examination of the 1175 proposals.
We will soon develop a map to help visualize the specific locations of origin of the proposals.
We will also give visibility to sites around the world that share similar interests related to the topic of the reach of their citizen media projects.
Only those projects that have given Rising Voices permission to share that information publicly will be included on the map.
Iran: Internet shutdown ahead of protest day
Slow and intermittent internet is a daily reality in Iran, but in recent days reports from inside the country are reporting that e-mail and secure internet (https:) have become inaccessible, and that the internet is so slow that anti-filtering programs cannot open web pages.
The partial power outage began on Thursday, February 9, 2012.
This protest Tuesday marks the one-year anniversary of the demonstrations called by Iranian opposition leaders in 2011 in solidarity with the popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia.
The physical repression during this day was brutal and left at least two dead in Tehran.

Spain: Repression against students continues in Valencia
Just days after the brutal police raids at the Instituto Lluis Vives in Valencia, students have once again been beaten, shoved and violently beaten by police in a peaceful demonstration in which students were protesting against police violence.
This time, the charges began in the afternoon with an unexpected force by the students.
The head of the Valencia police, Antonio Moreno, himself has referred to the protesters as "the enemy", these being young people from 12 to 17 years old, high school students.
Some 400 university students have locked themselves in the University of Valencia as a protest and in the face of imminent police charge inside the University, the Dean has denied entry to the "forces of order" who intended to dissolve the young people, invoking the principle of university autonomy.

Puerto Rico: March against the Pipeline
Hundreds of people from all over the island joined the "National March: Puerto Rico Firm Against the Gas Pipeline" held on Sunday, February 19 in the capital city of San Juan, Puerto Rico.The protesters marched from the Capitol to the Fortress to demonstrate their rejection of the Via Verde project proposed by the administration of Governor Luis Fortuño, which seeks to build a 92-mile-long pipeline to transport natural gas from the southern coast of the island to San Juan on the northern coast, crossing the central mountain range.
The march was called by the community organization Casa Pueblo based in the municipality of Adjuntas.
Casa Pueblo has been the entity that has led the singer's voice in the attempts to stop the so-called "Via Verde" project.
Environmentalists have pointed out that if the project is built it would adversely affect the aquifers and forests along the route, with irreparable damage to the island's ecosystem.
They've called it the "Death Tube".
Photojournalist Ricardo Alcaraz shares some of his images of the demonstration.
All images have been republished with your permission.
People from all walks of life joined the rally called by Casa Pueblo.
The protesters marched from the Capitol to the Fortress.
In the background you can see the west side of the Olympic House.
Several sectors have denounced that the project would cause serious damage to the island's flora and fauna.
The proposed route for the tube has several endangered species
Congressman Luis Gutiérrez also joined the demonstration.
There were a variety of artistic expressions during the protest.
No Puerto Rican protest can be without the favorite music of the demonstrations: the plenum.
Languages: International Mother Language Day in Mali
As in other parts of the world, Mali celebrated the International Mother Language Day on 21 February in Bamako.
The event, organized by the Ministry of Education, brought together educators, students and others interested in promoting the use of Mali's 13 native languages.
This year's theme focused on the production of printed books and learning materials in these languages, but there is strong interest in the role technology plays in revitalizing these languages.

Boukary Konaté, a blogger who writes and tweets (@fasokan) in French, English and Bambara, spoke about the day's events and his hopes that technology will play a role in promoting the use of these languages on the Internet.
Venezuela: Rumours about the President's health continue
In Venezuela, rumors outweigh information, particularly as regards the health of the President of the Republic.
Since the diagnosis of cancer several months ago, opinions and prognoses have not ceased.
Numerous press releases and data claiming to come from reliable but unidentified sources insist on the severity of the illness, while official voices claim that Hugo Chávez has recovered enough to continue his long presidential career.
Once again, the projections for the future are divided.
However, a tone of uncertainty is held in the political discussion ahead of presidential elections in October this year, and in response to the results of the opposition candidate's primary election.
For supporters of a new presidential term in which Chavez remains at the helm, new campaign strategies are needed that allow for an effective recovery of the president, as Carola expresses in her post "Chávez we are all":

Singapore: Criticism of "offensive" government announcement
An advertising campaign run by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sport (MCYS) was attacked for perpetuating prejudice and discrimination against ex-defendants, victims of abuse, people from lower income strata and people with disabilities.
The campaign includes a series of four posters showing social workers and examples of cases where they have been helpful.
The words "ruined", "destroyed", "abandoned" and "hopeless" have been underlined.
These posters can be seen on the internet, as well as in public areas such as bus stops.
Although the Society for Physically Handicapped People said it supported the ads, the ministry has been widely criticized by Singaporeans.
@flubberzz: "What the hell is up with MCYS and the Starlight ad??, who in their right mind came up with this kind of campaign?"
In response, the MCYS spokesman clarified that the word "without hope" in the poster does not refer to disabled people, but to the feeling of hopelessness they feel about their conditions.
Turkey: Clashes between police and Kurds celebrating Newroz
The Kurdish population in Turkey is the largest ethnic group in the country, making up 20 percent of the population, some 20 million Kurds.
The Turkish State has subjected this ethnic group to discrimination and human rights violations.
At the same time, on the morning of the 20th, two prominent Kurdish websites were blocked, thus preventing them from sending information about the clashes.
Yekbun Alp tweeted the arrest of a Kurdish member of parliament in clashes between riot police and Kurds celebrating Newroz:
Another Kurdish activist tweeted this image of riot police firing tear gas at Kurdish youths, who respond with stones, expressing frustration at not being able to celebrate the Kurdish New Year without being attacked:

Argentina: Documentary about the descendants of indigenous people in Buenos Aires
This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights.
The documentary Runa Kuti, Urban Indigenous, shows the stories of four descendants of indigenous peoples living in the city of Buenos Aires, and how they struggle to reclaim their identity, rediscover their culture and make a place in the city.
I'm not sure what you're talking about.
The documentary focuses on several descendants of original cultures living in Buenos Aires.
They tell their stories and share how they were raised: some grew up protected from their own roots, as their parents decided to take care of them from exclusion and discrimination, and therefore did not teach them the indigenous language or culture; and others were raised without knowing their ancestral origins.
They decided to accept and adopt their traditions and culture, and in that way strengthen themselves and feel proud of their roots.
Runa Kuti, urban indigenous, directed by Paola Castaño and Dailos Batista Suárez, has participated in several film festivals and, to get the message out to as many people as possible, they have registered it under Creative Commons license.
In the March 12, 2012 post, they explain:

United Arab Emirates: Activist arrested for tweeting
Saleh Aldhaifairi's tweet when he was arrested
With the rise of the Arab Spring, the UAE authorities seem to be intimidated by any voice that calls for reform or change.
It all started with the arbitrary arrests of five activists for signing an online petition and their illegal detention for months before they were granted 'pardon' as part of the annual national celebrations.
Shortly after, seven political activists were stripped of their citizenship following an order issued by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the United Arab Emirates.
Dubai Police spokesman announced that Saleh Al Dhafairi has been arrested on charges of incitement.
The spokesman confirmed that Al Dhafairi will be referred to the Attorney General after 48 hours emphasizing that the law punishes the seditious.
He added that what the defendant did falls under the jurisdiction of federal laws.

Peru: Rains overflow rivers and flood Loreto
The rains in Peru never stop.
In addition to heavy rains during February and March in much of the Peruvian coastal mountain range and jungle, floods are now occurring in the lowland rainforest of the country, mainly in the Loreto and Ucayali regions.
For weeks, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (Senamhi) of Loreto had warned of high levels of overflow reached by the Huallaga, Ucayali, Marañón and Amazonas rivers.
And although some authorities took measures in this regard it seems that it was not with the due anticipation, for example the Regional President of Loreto requested to declare an emergency in Loreto when there were already 40,000 damaged by the floods.
Although the area dates back to the last century, no mayor in Belen has made a plan or project to modernize the area, including the construction of decent housing and the addition of basic services.
Punchana and Iquitos are the districts most affected when rivers grow and definitely a project should be thought or developed to avoid excessive expenditure of resources in support of the affected citizens, as, indeed, there are alternatives to solve these problems.
A television program in Iquitos aired this report on the floods:
Finally, the following video is several shots of the flooded city of Iquitos: Post originally published on Juan Arellano's personal blog.
Lebanon: Palm Sunday and Easter celebrations
In Lebanon, two Christian celebrations took place on April 8, 2012, as churches following the Gregorian calendar celebrated Easter and churches following the Julian calendar remembered Palm Sunday.
This means that some Christians will celebrate Easter on Sunday, April 15.
In 2013 the two Easter celebrations will be much more separate, on March 31 and May 5.

Tunisia: Trouble over protest ban on main avenue of capital
Tunisian netizens have expressed their annoyance over the ban on protesting on Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunisia, the main avenue of the capital and the Tunisian equivalent of Cairo's Tahrir Square.
On March 28, the Tunisian Interior Ministry banned all protests, claiming to have received complaints from commercial and tourist businesses located on the avenue.
This is Habib Bourguiba Avenue.

Slim Amamou, Tunisian blogger and former State Secretary for Youth, tweeted: Has Interior become a legislator to ban the constitutional right to protest?
They say Habib Bourguiba Avenue is off-limits...
What is this?
He called for a protest: The state of emergency ends tomorrow, March 30, in Tunisia.
Go and protest!
Don't listen to the words of the Interior.
Blogger and wikipedian Habib M'henni responded to Amamou's tweet by saying: An implicit extension of the state of emergency that is looming this month.
Prominent blogger Azyz Amami, who was imprisoned during the Tunisian Revolution, also responded to Slim Amamou's tweet:
Bolivia: Serious attempt to lift UN ban on coca leaf?
Public actions and demonstrations, led by coca producers and traders, took place on Monday, March 12, 2012, in many cities in Bolivia, to demand the international decriminalization of coca leaf.
Eduardo Bowles, a blogger based in La Paz commented:
We must remember that this is not the first time that the Bolivian president has followed the ritual of the acullico in the UN, a fact that did not result in tangible benefits for the image of coca in the world.
The goal of the coca trade unions and the Bolivian government is to decriminalize not only coca cultivation but also consumption, which is prohibited by the United Nations Convention on Narcotic Drugs, something that President Morales has called a "historic mistake".
However, Mario Duran Chuquimia, a blogger from El Alto, says:
In Bolivia, however, the situation is more complex.
A study of the Celin found that the aculix tends to go down.
Identifies the mining sector as the most coca-pipe-picking
Another journalist, Andrés Gómez (@AndrsGomezV), director of the community radio of the Erbol network, also commented on Twitter:
Good morning on the day intended to remind that the acullicu is unjustly banned in Bolivia by the 1961 Convention
Eduardo Bowles concludes in his post:

Kuwait: Stateless people light candles for freedom
In protest against discriminatory state policies and arbitrary arrests, Kuwait's stateless community (or Bedoon, an Arabic word meaning "without" or "dispossessed") decided to light candles in their homes and post photos of the event on Twitter.
The idea was suggested by blogger 7anthala Al-Bedoon, who thought it would send a message to the authorities that "the struggle continues and that their peaceful opposition will not stop until they get their rights".
On Wednesday, April 4, a flood of photos flooded Twitter, in an attempt by people to express themselves through candles using the hashtag #شمعة_حرية_وأمل, which means "a candle for freedom and hope".
Here are some of the images shared:
The image uploaded by @m_mubher contains a line written by Palestinian poet Mahmoud Darwish: We do the same as the prisoners and the unemployed; we harbor hope.

Armenia: How to reduce rural poverty
With a GDP (gross domestic product) per capita estimated in 2011 at only $5,400, Armenia is one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union.
But while the development of the capital's center, Yerevan, may make a different impression on some tourists, especially its large diaspora, the economic situation is more evident in the regions south of the Caucasus.
"What we are trying to do is gather information and disseminate it, so that people can have an understanding of what village life is like in Armenia", explains the text accompanying a promotional video of ը գնում է գյուղ (Tim goes to the village), also known as Direct to the village.
Using mostly internet tools, a blog as well as a site on Facebook and Pinterest are used to promote the initiative.

India: Young women learn how to create participatory videos
A group of young women from the suburbs of Hyderabad in India, are learning how to create videos to change their communities, and in their next recording they will share what they have learned and how they are helping their communities and themselves through this work.
Namita Singh, who is doing her PhD research on participatory video, has a dual role in this process.
An experienced trainer in the production of videos for communities, in addition to writing toolboxes and guides for media training aimed at women and children, she also studies the learning process of these women.
While she was recording the video documenting the women's process, they asked her to continue with the training while they were recording.
Namita Singh comments on this experience on her blog:  Namita Singh, the trainer versus Namita Singh, the researcher: things I taught and things I learned! :
After all, the people they wanted to involve with the video were their community.

Video: Indigenous communities document their growth and governance
The Indigenous Territory and Governance portal is composed of institutions that work in collaboration to provide indigenous peoples in Latin America with the tools and resources to help strengthen governance in their territory and community.
They document their progress through short videos.
In Colombia, the Association of Indigenous Cabildos of Northern Cauca (ACIN) brings together over 14 reserves and 16 indigenous cabildos, and through their efforts, indigenous communities have begun to take control of their own economy and environment.
They do this through small businesses producing milk, fruit juices, bread rolls and bread; and they market these products to supply community shops and help other social projects in the community.
Through trade, training and centralization of products, they try to provide food security to indigenous communities and also provide sources of income.
In Ecuador, the Kichwa Pastaza Nation has a territory of 1 624 778 hectares belonging to 131 communities.
They have been managing the area sustainably for several years now, and in the following video they share their experiences in developing a Territorial Management Plan.
This Plan, based on the zoning of their territory, allows them to live off the land for many years without exhausting it and at the same time exercise their constitutional rights to make use of their own land.
So far only these two videos have been released.
We hope that more will be done, based on experiences in other Latin American countries.

I still wonder how she has such courage, but I guess nothing can answer my question better than what she wrote in her Twitter bio:
Languages: The digital sounds of the besiro (Chiquitano)
The Bolivian Constitution recognizes 36 indigenous languages as official languages of the State.
Three of these languages, Quechua, Aymara and Guarani, are the most widely spoken languages and are also spoken in neighboring countries.
On the other hand, finding resources and content available in the other 33 languages is a constant challenge for their communities.
Currently, in the department of Santa Cruz, a project is underway that aims to address this issue through digital media to produce their own online content, in the hope of encouraging more people to preserve and promote their language.
At the Department of Humanities and Education of the Autonomous University Gabriel René Moreno in Santa Cruz, a group of young linguists led by Ignacio Tomicha Chuve, have started a project called Monkox Bésiro to put the Béjiro (Chiquitano) language on the digital map.
This language is spoken by the Chiquitano people in several provinces in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni, with an estimated 20,000-60,000 speakers approximately.
In addition to opening a Twitter account (@MonkoxBesiro) and a Facebook page, the project uses SoundCloud to upload recordings made by themselves or during visits to their native communities, such as San Antonio de Lomerio.
For example, here is a short bilingual lesson in Bézir and the correct pronunciation of consonants:

Quechua: Words of encouragement from the mayor of Haquira
When Irma Álvarez Ccoscco, coordinator of the new Rising Voices beneficiary project Llaqtaypa Riymaynin (Voices from my community) returned to her hometown Haquira, Peru, she received an overwhelming show of support from the locals and local authorities.
She was visiting Lima and took the opportunity to inform the community that her project was recently selected as the new Rising Voices charity project.
The program seeks to work with migrants from Haquira who now live in the capital, encouraging them to maintain their native language, Quechua, by producing audio podcasts about their culture and community.
In the project blog, Irma describes this meeting with the city residents, which was called by SMS messages.
After briefly describing the project to the people who were gathered and how this initiative will help to tell the story of Haquira in the Quechua language, they invited Rolando Curiyumay, the mayor of the city, to eat "hakitu" (roasted wheat and wheat).
Irma wrote: "When you are in another land, the love of family and the need to share what you have arise".
After this fellowship, Curiyumay said some short poetic words with some advice for Irma and the project:

New conflict on the TIPNIS road
This post is part of our special coverage International Relations and Security.
The road project in Bolivia that plans to cross Isiboro Sécure Indigenous Territory and National Park (TIPNIS) is once again generating conflict and protest.Indigenous organizations, TIPNIS residents and their supporters, started a new march on April 27, 2012, from Trinidad to La Paz, demanding the end of the project.
The 306-kilometer road plans are the result of a $415 million agreement signed by the presidents of Bolivia and Brazil in August 2009.
The TIPNIS march arrived in La Paz in October 2011.
By Szymon Kochański on flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) This is a very good article.
In October 2011, after a long march of indigenous and protestors reached La Paz, President Evo Morales passed a law declaring TIPNIS intangible  or  untouchable , which was understood by environmental activists and indigenous organizations as the final word on the issue.
The indigenous inhabitants of TIPNIS - supported by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB) - claim that these constitutional mechanisms should have been carried out before any agreement or contract was signed.
A large number of indigenous organizations and citizens recognize that Evo Morales - himself an indigenous leader and coca farmer - has improved their situation.
However, indigenous organizations emphasize that their protest is for their right to be consulted before policies regarding their territories are implemented.
This video shows interviews with indigenous people from TIPNIS and their views on the road project.
The environmental impact of the road is another problem that generates protests, particularly among Bolivia's middle and urban class.
Still, the Bolivian government insists on the benefits of a road that would link the central area of the country, from where most illegal cocaine is produced, and where Evo Morales seeks support from the grassroots.
Coca producer organisations openly support the road as it can provide opportunities to expand production in the TIPNIS National Park.
Inevitably, this raises more suspicion among environmentalists, international organizations and the public.
The debate also continues on social media platforms, particularly on Twitter (under the hashtag #TIPNIS).
One of the questions simply says are you for or against the #TIPNIS road?
Among the answers were:
I think q should be integrated into the country, if the optimal is to go through the TIPNIS q so be it,q the road pass x where it is best for Bolivia
Criticism also goes to the relationship between the road project and the Brazilian-backed Initiative for the Integration of South American Regional Infrastructure (IIRSA), a development plan to unite South American economies through new energy, transportation and telecommunications projects.
According to the article by researcher Gustavo Soto on the CEADESC blog:
Costa Rica: Climbing Chirripó, the highest peak in the country
The highest point in Costa Rica is Cerro Chirripó, at 3,820 meters (12,533 feet) above sea level.
Over the years, it has attracted many locals and foreigners to climb to the top: the following videos show two very different experiences.
One of the first expeditions in 1960, and a hike to the summit in our time.
In the documentary Hikes of Courage: Climbing Chirripó in 1960, a team of young men and women make a long expedition to reach the highest peak in Costa Rica.
We follow their progress in car, ox carts and on horseback, until they begin their week-long climb to the summit.
It was also the first time that women were documented to reach the summit.
Narrated by one of the expeditioners, meteorologist Rodrigo de la Ossa, the story is full of anecdotes about the journey, which is now being made by another shorter route.

Currently, the climb to Chirripó is about 19.5 Km (12.1 miles), with the obligation to spend the night near the summit in a camp.
The following subtitled documentary posted by tetsuo1337 shows his experience climbing to the peak in 2010.
Venezuela: Street art on the Internet
Street artists and musicians expand their audience when they encounter citizen media.
In Venezuela, where music and theater are part of daily life, traffic and buses, some of the citizen journalists share their travels when they meet the artists who color urban life.
Similarly, the same artists prepare short videos and documentaries showing the performances of various street musicians.
In this video, made by the same artists for the street singers festival, you can see many of the musicians who are in various cities of the country:
At the same time, Cinetica13 shares the performance of a very popular street musician from the city of Mérida.
Theater also has its place in Venezuelan street art.
Perucho Morales shares on his YouTube account the performances of the group "Comediantes", also in Mérida.

Bolivia: Workshop teaches teachers how to use Web 2.0 platforms
On May 2 and 3, 2012, a workshop on Web 2.0 management was held in the Department of Oruro, Bolivia.
It was organized by the Ministry of Education and Jaqi Aru, a group of young linguists in El Alto, Bolivia who are promoting the use of the Aymara language on the Internet.
Many members of the Global Voices Aymara translation team are also part of this group.
The workshop was aimed at teachers in Higher Schools of Teacher Training (ESFM), and the aim was to facilitate teachers and their students to disseminate articles written in Aymara using digital media.
The workshop was organised as follows:
On Thursday 3 May, at 9:30am in the meeting room, the workshop was inaugurated by the facilitators of the Jaqi Aru team.
Then, Mario Duran Chuquimia gave a lecture on Web 2.0 and Wikipedia.
After the midday, the workshops were held in a computer room, where each teacher had a computer with Internet access.
Martin Canaviri then spoke about managing social media, focusing on Facebook, and Ruben Hilare shared about managing Twitter.

On Friday, May 4, Elias Quispe presented about using WordPress, and Edwin Quispe about running Skype.
Hilare then presented on the management of Aymara Wikipedia.
The workshop concluded in the meeting room with a short evaluation, in which the teachers thanked the youth of Jaqi Aru and the Ministry of Education for organizing the workshop and for the training.
The professor René Chura Quispe of ESFM Mariscal Andrés de Santa Cruz Calahumana, from the department of La Paz, said:

Afghanistan: Girls poisoned for going to school
On 3 June 2012, about 65 girls were taken to hospital after being poisoned at their school in the northeastern Afghan province of Tajar.
On May 29, about 160 girls ended up in hospitals after a gas attack on their school.
Authorities have blamed the Taliban for these incidents.
Between 1996 and 2001, when the fundamentalist movement controlled most of the country, women were forbidden to attend school.
Although millions of girls have enrolled in school since the Taliban's overthrow, the movement's fighters and supporters continue to punish girls for seeking education.
Young schoolgirls lie unconscious in the garden of a hospital in the capital city of the northern province of Tajar after being poisoned at their school.

Because women continue to face abuse and violent attacks for seeking education, it takes a lot of courage to be a schoolgirl in Afghanistan.
Image by Teresa Nabais, copyright Demotix (03/07/2009) This is a very good example of how the Internet can help.
They deny involvement in these attacks, but their own history, in which many girls were not even allowed to go to school during the Taliban regime of 1996-2001, suggests that educated women are against the interests of the Taliban.

Iran: "We save Lake Urmia with our tears"
Protesters fighting to save Lake Urmia in Iran from permanent environmental damage have not given up.
On May 21, 2012, people in Urmia and several other cities in Iran's Azerbaijan region again called on the government to save the dying Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest saltwater lakes.
In Khoy (pictured), protesters hung a sign on a bridge that says "the death of Lake Urmia is the death of Azerbaijan".
A blogger posted a cartoon saying "We save Lake Urmia with our tears".
Here are a couple of videos of the demonstrations in Urmia posted by Iranian citizens.

Greece: Attacks on migrants by neo-Nazi Golden Dawn supporters increase
A group of 15 to 20 supporters of Golden Dawn, the Greek neo-Nazi political party that surprisingly won a big victory in the last election, attacked a Pakistani man in his 30s on May 29, 2012 in Athens, specifically at the Agios Nikolaos metro station, a neighborhood known for its high immigrant population.

They then went to the man, threw him to the ground and beat him, while the shocked passengers watched what was happening.
Saudi Arabia: Protests for the release of detainees without trial
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is believed to have thousands of detainees who have not been allowed access to trial and many of whom still do not know their charges.
The families of the detainees have been working for the past few months through social media to spread the message and finally decided to take their cause to the streets. @e3teqal, a Twitter account, posted information about the protest just before it began to avoid a heavy police presence.
Days before the protests, the account posted this invitation showing pictures of the detainees in the same way Palestinian prisoners were symbolized in a recent social media campaign:
The account also posted a photo confirming the participation of the children of the detainees in the protest:
Sign reads: Haila Al-Qasir was sentenced to 15 years in jail for calling for justice, is that fair?
We stand in solidarity with our brothers in Riyadh; we couldn't come because our male guardians are in jail.
News of the arrests were posted on the internet shortly after the protests.

Iran: Jailed blogger starts hunger and thirst strike
To the tragic situation of Iranian bloggers is now added a new victim: Hossein Ronaghi Maleki, a blogger in prison, sentenced to 15 years in prison.
His father claims that prison is torture for him because of his kidney problems.
Hossein has been through the operating room five times, but after each operation he has been sent back to the prison, which has no medical equipment, no proper nutrition for him and no nephrology specialists.
Hossein started a hunger strike on May 19, 2012 for a simple reason: to have the right to stay in the hospital after the operation and not go back to prison.
Adam Evolution says of Hossein Ronaghi Maleki: "He is a very good man.
He is not a singer or a football player; he is not an exhibitionist or an actor.

Photos: Internal meeting before the Global Voices Summit
For three days in the run-up to the Global Voices Summit 2012 in Nairobi, Kenya our community has been meeting in private to discuss new issues and ideas related to Global Voices.
To learn more about the process, read this long post, and enjoy these images of Global Voices member meetings anyway.
Mexicans elect their next president
On July 1, Mexicans went to the polls to elect their next president.
From before the elections, the feeling among most netizens was that it would be a very close race between Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) of the Democratic Revolution Party, although supporters of Josefina Vázquez Mota (of the current ruling party) did not lose hope.
As soon as the polls opened, netizens began sharing their ideas and experiences.
Twitter user @YONOFUI stated:
A look back at the first day of Global Voices Citizen Media Summit
The 2012 Global Voices Summit kicked off on July 2 in Nairobi with a song performed by award-winning Kenyan artist Atemi, who took the stage to welcome the more than 300 attendees to the capital.
The event is a biannual gathering that brings together bloggers, activists and technologists from around the world to hold public debates and workshops on the rise of social media movements around the globe.
Citizen media in #GV2012.

Following a warm welcome from Daudi Were, founder of Kenyan Blogs Webring, American social media scholar and Global Voices co-founder Ethan Zuckerman moderated an international discussion table on the rise of social media.
GV's Southeast Asia editor Mong Palatino showed us an overview of various social media campaigns in the region, including #thaiflood and Bersih.
He explained how a mix of activism on and off the internet could lead to mobilizations and real change.
Amira al Hussaini, a prominent Bahraini activist, explained how the protests in Egypt and Tunisia last year inspired the Arab region and then the world.
Matisse Bustos Hawkes, of WITNESS, explained how people share and disseminate information even where the internet is limited, through USB, CD and DVD drives.
Finally, Pakistan's Faisal Kapadia expressed concern that we are witnessing the golden era of internet freedom, if we do not act now against censorship.
Then the sessions began, one on social networks of Kenyan citizens, which highlighted how cyber tools and channels are not only conveying opinions, but affecting how people live in the country (follow #kot on Twitter to learn about the latest rumors on Kenyan social networks). #Occupy Everywhere, on the other hand, is about different global "enemies" but with a common goal: equal rights and justice. Berkman Center contributor Zeynep Tufek led a discussion on Arab uprisings and how to create moderate effective networks that help echo what was happening last year in places like Egypt and Tunisia.
The challenge of keeping endangered languages alive on the internet was also discussed, including issues such as the lack of writing, as well as letters and keyboards.
The afternoon's "non-conference" sessions allowed audience members to propose and lead discussion groups on a wide range of topics such as "How Facebook spies on you", #OccupyYourself and current issues about Burma (Myanmar).
Discussion groups at #GV2012
Bob Boorstin from Google, Max Schrems (Europe vs. Facebook) and Ramzi Jaber (onlinecensorship.org) joined GV's Ivan Sigal in the debate 'Internet giants: their role and responsibility?'
Bob Boorstin claimed that the internet is not a place without borders  if you cross the boundaries, the laws change  and also expressed his belief that technological monopolies do not last.
Ramzi Jaber announced the launch of onlinecensorship.org, a website where you can report if your account or content is being censored.
Ory Okolloh, the original editor of GV Africa and co-founder of Ushahidi, who is also the current head of Google's Africa policy, answered a question from the audience about whether African network users are aware of how to protect their rights online.
As a highlight of the day, the Breaking Borders Prize was presented: read the following report.

Review of the second day of Global Voices Citizen Media Summit
Group photo from the 2012 Summit
The second and final day of the Global Voices Citizen Media Summit 2012 began as it ended the first night: with music.
As the audience rose and took their seats, a quartet of musicians, the Sheru ni Sheru group, marched to the stage, playing the drum and dancing to the beat of the morning call.
Fully alert, the Summit attendees were introduced to Boukary Konaté from Mali and Victoria Tinta from Bolivia, both winners of the Rising Voices GV scholarships.
Currently, Boukary, along with other people, is leading the Segu Villages Connection Project.
This project visits each school in rural Mali and seeks to create cultural ties between the city and the villages by teaching how to use the network.
Victoria Tinta, for her part, grew up in Bolivia speaking the Aymara language and during her university years began using the Internet to mobilize the Aymara community.
Currently, Victoria works with a group called Jaqi Aru, which runs blogger workshops for Aymara speakers with the aim of strengthening the Aymara language's presence on the web.
The Summit was then divided into three groups of special panels.
Jillian York launched the provocative program titled "Are We Being Watched?", which sparked a debate about potentially justified surveillance and the needs for privacy and political freedom. Robert Faris, research director at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, explored the trade-offs between law enforcement and transparency standards, while citizen journalists Afef Abrougui from Tunisia and Mohamed El Gohary from Egypt described the dangers and practical obstacles faced by dissidents of government and corporate surveillance.
In another group, panelists met to discuss the importance of using citizen media to organize mass actions, especially focused on Kenya.
After a short break, the Summit continued with a second round of special sessions.
Gilad Lotam, Vice President of SocialFlow, moderated "Information Visualization", which explores the methods by which analysts and promoters gather, organize and project information in both activist and scientific contexts.
Rebecca MacKinnon, co-founder of GV, chaired a separate panel on citizen participation in the future of the Internet, and asked the audience to focus on how ordinary people act when governments fail to stand up for popular interests.
A third group met to discuss the challenge of "creating an African network", and what is needed to establish relationships and unity between local citizen media and the outside world to sustain the project.
After lunch, the Summit kicked off two sets of open programmes covering about a dozen different topics, such as China-Africa relations, women and technology, and open resources.
Finally, before the Summit ended with a night of music and a Kenyan barbecue, Global Voices paid tribute to its co-founders and organizers.
When Executive Directors Ivan Sigal and Georgia Popplewell formally concluded the Summit, a group of over 200 people, including GV staff and volunteers, fellows and local visitors stood up and marked the occasion with applause and smiles.
See you at the next summit!
Spain: support for the mining struggle: Yes, they do represent us!
Thousands of people took to the streets to show their support for the Spanish miners and join them after they arrived in Madrid after having walked 400 kilometers from northern Spain.
The demonstration began at 22h on Tuesday 10 July, in La Moncloa, the seat of government, and concluded at the Puerta del Sol at two in the morning.
Coal miners are protesting the austerity measures of the government of Mariano Rajoy and government cuts to subsidies.
The event, which was called the "Black March", was held in an emotional and solidarity-filled atmosphere.
The miners expressed their surprise at the strong mobilization they achieved, a fact that added intensity to what is known in the networks as the #nocheminera.
Tour of the Black March through the center of Madrid, by Ismael Naranjo
Among the most popular slogans were:  Yes we can! ,  Yes, they do represent us!  and  This is our national team! , in reference to Spain's recent football victory at the European Championship.
The coal workers not only lit the streets with the lanterns placed on their foreheads: they were also light for the protesters in a broader sense.
Many other sectors identified with his cause, including anarchists, indignant 15M, people of all ages and from various regions of Spain.
The struggle for the mines has become the fist of workers' protest and the most radical rejection of government cuts.
I'm not going to lie.
On social media, many people encouraged the miners to continue fighting against the cuts that could lead to the disappearance of their sector.
A large number of Twitter users claimed to be proud of Spain's miners through their messages and through the hashtag #yosoyminero.
As in previous protests, it was the networks that spread the most information, in the face of what users denounced as a #media silence.
The historic mining protest resumed in the capital on Wednesday 11 July from the morning.
However, it turned out to be a much more terrible day than the previous one, due to violent clashes between riot police and protesters.
The altercations resulted in more than 76 wounded and a dozen detainees.
A weak African Union for its 53 member countries
This post is part of our coverage International Relations and Security.

2011 was a tumultuous year for the African continent, with revolutions, attempted coups and violent political crises.
Unfortunately, the union of 53 African States, whose mission is to contribute to strengthening regional peace and development, has shown its own shortcomings in dealing with these situations.
The African Union, created in 1999 after the dissolution of the Organisation of African Unity, was unable to resolve the post-electoral crisis in Ivory Coast, offering belated support to the popular movements of the Arab Spring, and its position on Libya was determined largely by the influence of the late Colonel Gaddafi on the organisation.
All this has led many African citizens to doubt whether the Union is really capable of fulfilling its mission.
This is very clear when studying the blogs of commentators from across the region.
In the context of the crisis in Mali, the organization seems to be drifting.

Declaration for Internet Freedom
As many have pointed out, the world is at a crucial moment in terms of internet freedom.
Many countries have created laws to censor the web, while bloggers are increasingly at risk for speaking out.
Over the past year, organizations around the world have come together like never before to fight for Internet freedoms.
From the fight against SOPA and PIPA in the United States, to the global efforts that ended the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), we have embraced a spirit of freedom and openness on the Internet.
With this in mind, numerous groups have recently joined together to draft a Declaration for Internet Freedom, of which Global Voices Advocacy has been one of the original signatories.
To date, this declaration has been signed by more than 1300 organisations and companies, and this number is still growing.
The text of the declaration is available below.
You can sign the declaration here; you can also participate through various organizations, such as EFF, Access, and even Cheezburger.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
We believe that a free and open internet can make a better world.
To keep the internet free and open, we ask communities, businesses and countries to recognize these principles.
We join an international movement to defend our freedoms because we believe they are worth fighting for.
We discuss these principles,  we will accept or refute them, we will debate them, we will translate them, we will make them our own and we will spread the discussion to our community  as can only be possible on the internet.
Join us in keeping the internet free and open.
The Commission has not yet adopted a decision.
We stand for a free and open internet.
We support transparent and participatory processes to regulate the Internet and the establishment of five basic principles:
Expression: The Internet should not be censored.
Access: Promote universal access to fast and affordable networks.
Openness: The Internet must remain an open network where everyone is free to connect, communicate, write, read, see, speak, listen, learn, create and innovate.
Innovation: Protecting the freedom to innovate and create without permission.
New technologies must not be blocked, and innovators must not be punished for the actions of users.
Privacy: Protect privacy and defend people's ability to control how their data and devices are used.

Argentina: Liu Song, table tennis player, shocks Twitter
Being a Chinese Argentine national with barely a rudimentary Spanish, he represented us and did his job more than well, so I think he represents all those other disciplines that don't sell, that don't get ratings up, but go unnoticed for four years and nobody gives them the slightest attention, to them, the best of wishes, and eye, not to be confused, which doesn't mean you don't support the "famous" disciplines, but what I want is that they all be important, even if the only chance is to pass just one round.
Song, who already represented Argentina at the Olympics in 2000, 2004 and 2008, revolutionized Argentine Twitter users, and that is why throughout the weekend the hashtag #Songuito, as a diminutive of Song, was a local trend.
@pibecristino: ♬ #songuito, my good friend, this olympiad we will return to this one with you, we will show you oooo 'the spanishoool ♬

Bolivia: Is anti-US rhetoric hurting their diplomatic relations?
This post is part of our special coverage International Relations and Security.
In the last decade, the balance of power has shifted in South America.
The US hegemony in the region in the second half of the 20th century has been challenged, mainly by Brazil's strong showing, but also by political initiatives led by leftist governments such as Bolivia.
Despite its relatively small size, the landlocked country in the heart of South America has led anti-US initiatives since 2006, when President Evo Morales, a left-wing indigenous leader and coca-growing trade unionist, was democratically elected.
Raul Prada Alcoreza, a former member of President Morales' party, describes the diplomatic context in the early days of 2006 on his blog:
Hong Kong: 10,000 people rally against 'National Education'
The controversy over the new "red" school curriculum has grown over the past week as parents' groups have joined affected students and teachers in blocking the government from introducing the curriculum in September.
On July 29, 2012, 10,000 Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest the brainwashing of the curriculum.
Despite the danger of extreme heat, many parents brought their babies.
Below is a selection of some of the photos from the rally, with permission to use:

The challenge is to raise awareness about the global water and sanitation crisis and raise funds to ensure clean water for people.
The founder of Challenge 21, Jake Norton, seeks to do this by climbing the three highest peaks on each continent and the following couple of videos give us a glimpse of what he's doing.
Recently he climbed the top of the 3rd highest peak in North America, Pico de Orizaba in Mexico. Josh Wolff documented the first ascent of his life with a video and an article on Gadling travel blog.
My most recent adventure took me to the border between Puebla and Veracruz in Mexico in an attempt to reach the third highest peak in North America (18,500 feet), the stratovolcanic Pico de Orizaba.
It wasn't a normal climb.
It is one of the most pressing issues of our time.
With 7 summits already conquered, including Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Stanley as well as 3 North American summits, the 3 to 4 year project is quite advanced.
The Challenge 21 Youtube channel has several videos of the Everest expedition, as well as many showing the sanitation facilities at Everest Base Camp.
The site has more information about the expeditions as well as links to donate to the organization Water for the People and social media accounts to follow the progress of the project.
The expeditions conducted by Jake Norton and Challenge21 are fully funded by external sources.
In other words, any money donated to Water for People will go 100% to Water for People and its programs around the world.
No donations made through Challenge 21 or Water for the People will be used to cover the costs of expeditions or any other aspect of Challenge 21.
Sharing photos of Afghanistan you never see
Decades of war and terrorism have placed Afghanistan among the most dangerous countries in the world.
Sharing his views on the label, Ford writes in Warfare magazine:
Local kids ready to talk to military personnel as they leave the helicopter landing site.
The tag has become a popular photo tag for those traveling to Afghanistan to share images that people outside the country rarely see in mainstream media.
Then Iqbal Ahmad Oruzgani, an Afghan photographer, started posting photos with the tag to show Afghanistan from a different perspective.

Bolivia: communities divided by TIPNIS road consultation
Emily Achtenberg of Rebel Currents blogs about the latest developments in the project to build a road through Isiboro-Sécure Indigenous Territory and National Park (TIPNIS): "Last week, the Bolivian government launched a highly debated community consultation process.
The affected communities responded with a wide range of creative tactics  some supportive and some resistant  that show the deep divisions between them".

Iran: When earthquakes kill, "TV broadcasts prayers"
Two strong earthquakes shook the province of East Azerbaijan, northwest of Iran, on Saturday, August 11, 2012, killing 250 people and injuring about 1,800.
The earthquakes measured 6.4 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and left a trail of destruction and suffering.
The representative of Iran's supreme leader in East Azerbaijan said this earthquake reminds us of "Judgment Day".
People are under the rubble and need help, but Iranian channels are broadcasting religious programming and one of them shows "Down with America"...
Aandishe reflects on the tragedy, and wonders why one never learns from mistakes:

Historic photos commemorated the anniversary of the 1988 Myanmar uprising
August 8, 2012 marked the 24th anniversary of the biggest uprising in Myanmar's political history - the 1988 pro-democracy protests.
Although the public has had to commemorate in silence without any leader opposing the government of the activist Generation of '88 in past years, it was likely that this year's anniversary would include leaders of the uprising, such as Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, among others.
A Facebook page known as Myanmar Political Review that was created in July and gathered over a thousand fans in a matter of days, shared several photos with views before the 1988 uprising.
Here are some of those images:

This year, Myanmar President Thein Sein officially sent two ministers to the monastery where a donation ceremony for the Buddhist full moon day of Warsaw was held on August 7 by members of the Generation 88 Student Organization.
The two ministers, representing the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Transport by Rail, respectively donated to the monastery for the ceremony and the Student Organization Generation 88.

Venezuela: Mourning in chaos after oil refinery explosion
A gas tank exploded at 1am today, August 25, at the Amuay Refinery, in Judibana, Falcón state.The explosion has so far left a total of 24 dead (Falcón media report 35 dead already) and 86 injured.
Several citizen videos of the explosion have been shared on YouTube:
José Luis Cova R (@JLCova) commented through his Twitter account:
The entrance to Judibana and everything around it is destroyed
Most of the injured and affected by the explosion were transferred to the Calles Sierra Hospital which does not have enough supplies to care for the people there, as reported by Gabriela Gonzalez (@gabriela2400):
Pakistan: A motor that runs on water?
A Pakistani engineer claimed he could make a car run on a water engine.
Agha Waqar Ahmad, the proud inventor of the engine, is now on the lips of all traditional and social media; he became famous after having recently participated in several talk shows.
The Pakistani are overwhelmed by the idea of a water-powered engine.
Several government officials saw a live demonstration of the engine and showed great interest in it.
People are already considering switching their CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) cars to water-powered ones.
However, there are many skeptics on social media.
As soon as the news broke, responses were quick on Twitter and Facebook and ranged from funny to scathing to favorable.
There was a point when the #WaterKit hashtag became very fashionable in Pakistan.
Ali Abbas Zaidi, a well-known youth activist, tweeted:
@Ali_Abbas_Zaidi: I can't stop laughing after watching @HamidMirGEO's show about #WaterKit.
To those who predicted the end of the world in 2012: your comments are welcome.
@Ali_Abbas_Zaidi: Agha Waqar has ignored the rules of physics with #WaterKit.
@NadeemfParacha: Now instead of oil we are going to import barrels from Zamzam Well? #WaterKit
It became clear that not everyone had the same sense of humor about the matter:
@Rabaail: All twitter biographies should be changed to  aspiring comedian  because everyone thinks #WaterKit is something very funny.
One of the problems that complicates this whole story is that so far none of the prestigious Pakistani physicists has personally examined the engine.
Cafe Pyala puts it this way:
@cpyala: Among the scientists  who support the invention of the #WaterKit car are a biologist and a centrifugal machinist. Very convincing! @HamidMirGEO
Majyd Aziz tweeted:
@Amjad_Hakro: Hyper-patriot #DrAbdulQadeerKhan, has referred to the  discovery  of #WaterKit as if it were real without having scientifically examined it. #fail #LOL
Talha Zareef tweeted:
@TalhaZareef: My mom just told me that #WaterKit is real and the demo proves it.
I think I'm definitely convinced.
Shahid Saeed, commented on some scientists' support for the water engine:
@majorlyprofound: The laws of thermodynamics have been declared null and void, against our religion and culture. #WaterKit
Given that Pakistan is going through a serious energy crisis, it is understandable that people want to believe in a  miracle .
But as they say, miracles don't exist.
This farce, which has been repeated dozens of times before, seems to be gaining followers in Pakistan.

Libya: Presenter without hijab forced to leave ceremony
There was a problem that spoiled the ceremony of the transfer of power from the Libyan National Transitional Council (NTC) to the recently elected 200-member Libyan National General Congress: the master of ceremonies was Sarah Elmesallati, who did not wear a veil, and was ordered to leave the stage after an Islamist parliamentarian walked out of the ceremony in protest at her being the presenter of the historic ceremony.
Internet users have taken to Facebook to show their outrage or support.
According to some news, Islamist Mistrata MP Salah Baadi was opposed to Elmesallati presenting the ceremony and shouted at him to cover himself.
Afterwards, she left the ceremony in protest and an assistant to the National Transitional Council, President Mustafa Abduljalil, asked Sarah to stop performing.
When Elmesallati refused, Abduljalil himself signaled him to stop immediately.
Eventually, she had to do it and was replaced by a host.
Screenshot from the Facebook page "We are all Sarah Elmesallati"
In response to this event, a Facebook page was created called We Are All Sarah Elmesallati.
The page is being used to discuss the situation of women in post-Gaddafi Libya but also to receive insults and support for the young presenter.
Also on Facebook this image is being widely viewed:
A picture showing Abduljalil shaking hands with an uncovered Hillary Clinton.
It shows a photograph of Elmesallati and Abduljalil shaking hands with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
It reads as follows:
Host Sarah Elmesallati was kicked out of the ceremony for being a woman who does not wear the hijab and for being from Libya.
Abduljalil said: "We are a conservative Muslim society that celebrates its religious practices and preserves its traditions and customs".
Hillary Clinton is a woman who does not wear a hijab and she could also be considered an infidel for that.
When you shook her hand, didn't you tell her that it's forbidden for a man to shake a woman's hand?
Is this a religious practice or an American tradition?
The image has been shared more than 250 times and so far has prompted about 730 comments on the Facebook page "We are all Sarah Elmesallati".
On Libyablog, Ahmed Al Bukhari writes: Although this incident shocked me because I never thought anything like this could happen, and despite the deep discomfort of activists, including those on the Facebook page "We are all Sarah Elmasallati", I do not blame Mustafa Abduljalil or the National Transitional Council for what happened.
We need to recognize that the big problem is the whole society and if society did not allow this kind of discrimination, no one would dare to do such things.
On the other hand, Libya Now - also on Facebook - writes an open letter to Elmesallati after she defended herself in an interview.
In an excerpt of the letter, it says the following: I personally have not spoken much earlier about the case of Sarah Elmesallati and it said "She had to be informed in another way".
However, after seeing his interview in this video, I have completely changed my mind.
In the aforementioned video, the self-righteous Sarah Elmesallati claims that she knows that hijab is a command from Allah and also said: "This is something between God and me".
He also commented that Allah had commanded the believer to lower his gaze but not to order women and ask them to wear the hijab.
This writer continues: She also said that we are a moderately religious state and I personally had to emphasize the word moderately.
That's not true, Sarah!
We are a completely Muslim country and you should fully examine and understand the expressions you have broadcast to this channel before uttering them in public.
Senegal: Floods kill 18 and paralyze country
On 26 August heavy rains caused catastrophic flooding in several regions of Senegal, killing 18 people and injuring 42 others as of 27 August.
Senegalese netizens have described the consequences of the floods in their regions.
Meanwhile, blogger Anna Gueye compiles the most impactful photos on social media and Claude André Coly talks about the difficulties experienced by the inhabitants of other regions:
Bolivia: are they seizing uranium in La Paz?
On 28 August 2012, Bolivian authorities seized two tons of solid material, allegedly uranium or radioactive minerals, which were being transported without any security or protective measures from a property in a central district of La Paz near several diplomatic offices.
The government minister Carlos Romero led the operation, carried out by special police units.
Later, Minister Romero reported that tests and analyses carried out by the laboratory determined that the material "is not radioactive.
It's not going to produce any affectation".
However, Romero also announced that the National Service of Geology and Mines Technician Sergeotecmin and the Bolivian Institute of Science and Nuclear Technology will continue to investigate, so the potential radioactivity of the material is still to be clarified.
Police seize two tons of uranium in Sopocachi, La Paz, on August 28.

The mainstream media immediately reported the event and covered it throughout the day.
On social media, concerns and comments were also expressed, including some ironic ones, with the hashtag #uranium.
Blogger and journalist Andres Gómez Vela commented on his Twitter account (@andrsgomezv):
@andrsgomezv: Look, Bolivia doesn't produce #uranium, where did this shipment come from?
Maybe he was in transit to another country, says Vice Minister Pérez
In addition, netizens are criticizing the precarious way in which a potentially radioactive material was first handled.
A quick tweet from Fernanda San Martin (@Fer_SanMartin) commenting on the matter prompted an immediate response from blogger and Twitter user Mario Durán (@mrduranch):
@AndrsGomezV: Some doubts #uranium: so far no expert has seen or certified it and if it was so radioactive why was it transported like sand?
Renan Justiniano (@renanjustiniano) concluded:
@renanjustiniano: If the mineral found yesterday is #uranium the first thing I should have done was to see if it was radioactive not call the press! #bolivia
Do not be afraid of the internet : An infographic
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
We've already shown you how the Internet, without freedom of speech, is not worth it; and how this right compromises things as simple as choosing a domain name.
It's that we're not always aware of freedom of expression on the Internet, we take it for granted.
However, many things we do on the web on a daily basis depend on this right, and without freedom of expression, these practices would be compromised for a variety of reasons: from censorship and police persecution in some countries to excessive criminal prosecution and copyright in Chile.
Now we present you with a new infographic from our #NoThemasInternet campaign, where we want to show, in very simple and didactic terms, some of the things we can do on the internet thanks to your right to freedom of expression.
Visit our Tumblr and get to know the infographic in more detail.
All links lead to pages in Hungarian.
Between 45 and 50 people live in makeshift huts in the abandoned forests along Feher and Terebesi roads in Budapest, the capital of Hungary.
In June 2012 and with little notice, the municipality of the X district of Budapest asked these people to leave their homes.
Some of the residents, who have lived in these neighborhoods for decades, have built farms for their own subsistence, while others have tried to make a living by collecting and selling scrap metal.
Several years ago, there were rumors that the city was planning to build an amusement park in the area.
Residents told atlatszo.hu journalists that social workers from the Red Cross and the Baptists informed them of the eviction and offered to stay in their shelters.
The human rights organization A Város Mindenkié (The city is for all) criticized the forced eviction and called it illegal; it also said that the housing conditions they are offered are worse than their current homes.

In June, the blog Kettős Mérce wrote about the news:
One after another the municipalities announce the decision to destroy the slums but offer no alternatives to help them.
However, shelters for homeless people offered as alternatives would not give them the opportunity to lead independent lives but would integrate them into a lifelong system.
There is currently no policy in Hungary to give people the opportunity to start an independent life.
In Város Mindenkié organized several protests in June against the forced eviction of the area's residents. (Share photos of  Terebesi Forest 'here.)
In their blog, they wrote that the municipality gave two weeks to local social workers to find a place to live for these 50 people.
They also said that shelters for the homeless were not an appropriate alternative, as homeless people can live there for up to two years and without an income would have nowhere to go.
Atlatszo.hu's investigation showed that the municipality of District X asked social workers to solve the problem  to support a real estate investment.
As deputy mayor, Tibor Weber informed atlatszo.hu journalists that the plans of the investor, the Sidi Group, to build 900 apartments, offices and some recreational areas are currently in an advanced phase of authorization.
Civil rights protests and growing media attention have apparently delayed the eviction, which now appears to have become a legal and negotiated process.
Many of the residents have already gone to the shelters, others still remain in the slums, but for now the process is on course.
Venezuela: Is a natural disaster coming to Mata Redonda?
Residents of the community of Mata Redonda, in the Venezuelan city of Maracay, have taken to the citizen media to denounce a possible natural disaster if the containment wall separating the area from Lake Valencia collapses.
The discussion started with the posting of a video on YouTube and its spread through Twitter and Facebook.
This was followed by the problem of pollution in the lake of Valencia and insufficient sanitation.
In recent days, videos have been shared that point to the possibility of an environmental disaster, and possible solutions or prevention measures have been discussed.
Many families are worried about having nowhere to go in the event of a flood, and many more set off alarms without being cared for.
User Ruckyto posted the video in question:
Romualdo Hostos, for his part, filmed the effect of the rains in the area weeks ago:
Hostos comments:
In the night of August 14 after a torrential rain in Maracay Edo Aragua, in the Urb Mata Round the Rio Madre Vieja Lindero of the 29th Manzanas of the urbanization overflows through the houses of the manzanas putting in the community, waiting for the environment ministry to execute the sentence of the TSJ.
The complaints continue on Twitter, where many are also wondering if Venezuela is in for another tragedy like Amuay's.
Sonia Guanipa (@soniaguanipar) writes:
Attention, this video taken today shows the next tragedy that will occur.
The retaining wall of Mata Redonda is about to collapse, and the water is over 2 meters above street level.
As soon as the wall breaks, the whole area will be flooded without anyone knowing what the damage will be.
Bolivia: Former minister demands clarification of repression via Facebook
The young minister left the cabinet of President Evo Morales hours after the news of the violent police intervention at the VIII Indigenous march in defense of the Indigenous Territory and Isiboro Sécure National Park (TIPNIS), on September 25, 2011, was spread.
Chacón published this note just as Sacha Llorenti, former government minister, was appointed as permanent ambassador to the United Nations (UN) in New York.
During the police intervention of the VIII March of the Indigenous, Llorenti performed functions as head of the police and direct authority responsible for security.
Note by Maria Cecilia Chacón on Facebook
Among the outstanding parts of her note, former minister Chacón points out:
It has been almost a year since the shameful repression in Chaparina, that day of violence committed against women, children.
What's really important?
Who prepared the plan?
Who suggested it?
Who authorized it?
Who executed him?
Who applauded the execution clean and without casualties ?
It matters what we saw, but it matters a lot more what we didn't see.
He further adds:
The process of change is not the monopoly of a party or an elite of enlightened.
No one should be considered an "invited guest" of the process, just as no one can think himself more important than another colleague.
We were strong because we were all there, side by side.
Fausto, an anonymous user, commented on the Rimay Pampa blog:
This letter is the most honest, clear, incisive, courageous, equitable, mature pronunciation; without rhetoric or figures or pseudo-intelligent requirements.
He acted correctly in stepping down to keep his ethics, and principles, intact.
We thank you very much for expressing in a clear and unequivocal way what the rest of us conscientious Bolivians would have liked to have expressed.
On the other hand, there were also criticisms of the note.
Rocio Llobet (@rociolloret) comments through his Twitter account:
@rociolloret: So wise the former minister Chacón, she knew the opposition would use her letter, when the underlying problem is another
While Ingrid Barrientos comments in the same note posted on Facebook:
You are not alone, your courage, it is the courage of many of us, your courage, we have shown it, and we will continue to do it, the impetus of Dignity that you have given, is an important point, we are neither of the right nor of the left, if we want a change for our Bolivia that starts from ourselves!!
China: Hulunbuir meadows destroyed by coal mining
The Hulunbuir grasslands, located in northwestern Inner Mongolia, provide a beautiful setting of wide pastures, forests, rivers, and lakes where Mongolian herders raise sheep and cattle.
It's also a very touristy place.
But as a result of mining activities near the surface, grasslands are eroding at a rapid rate.

Peru: Activists launch "civic crusade" to defend Nanay River
This is the second part of a series of three posts on the water problem in Iquitos city.
See the first one.
In the previous post we briefly introduced the water problem in Iquitos, and then exposed the controversy generated by the exploration and search for hydrocarbons by the transnational Conoco Phillips in the Nanay River basin.
Continuing the topic, not long ago the researcher Gonzalo Tello reflected on Conoco Phillips's actions in his article "El Agua Sagrada":
The main problem is that the CP is an environmental flattener with a patent of corso granted by the TLC with the US in the sense that, as they have already been handed the concessions, with the terms of reference of an operations plan approved by the Peruvian government (although it has several serious holes under the environmental floatation line, for which History should at least morally punish the responsible), this oil consortium is blinded  by said TLC to execute, yes or yes, its plans, at any cost, without anyone from the government opposing them, under the legal penalty of the binational instrument.

As for the Loreto Regional Government's response to this problem, Darrin Mortenson comments in an article for Alianza Arkana:
The issue has been a political taboo since U.S. mining company ConocoPhillips, stealthily moved into the region two years ago, despite Loreto Regional Government laws banning industrial production at the headwaters of the Nanay River.
Despite the laws, the government has been complacent with ConocoPhillips at all times since 2010.
Regarding the legal efforts that the Water Committee in Iquitos is making to force the publication of the impact studies, he adds:
The results will be shown as long as ConocoPhillips officials believe they have found oil and finally present the scope of the project to experts, activists and the general public - something the regional government has been desperately, but apparently illegally, trying to prevent.
Not only does the Regional Government have a questionable role in these events; according to the weekly La Verdad de Iquitos, it is laughable that the Management Committee of the affected area is chaired by "Perúpetro (the concession holder) and has as vice-president the representative of Conoco Phillips,
The Commission of Andean, Amazonian, Afro-Peruvian, Environment and Ecology of the Congress of the Republic announced that it will hold a decentralized session in Iquitos to discuss the problems caused by ConocoPhillips' operations in the Nanay River basin.
Given the limited resources the Committee has, they organized a cebichada to cover some of the commission's expenses in Lima.
The event was held on September 15 at the San Agustin school.
Elizabeth Lozano, spokeswoman for the Collective Amazon declared: We ask for the support of citizens who feel committed to the environment and its importance for the future of the Amazon, by buying a ticket of ten soles equivalent to a plate of Nanay's zúngaro cebiche, the  last  of the area that would be left alive if we allow high impact activities to be carried out in their spawning habitat.
On September 15, the spokesmen of the Water Committee met with a Conoco Phillips shareholder, who was visiting Iquitos, and reiterated the position of defence of the Nanay basin and the demand for the paralysis of all oil activity in the area.
Seamus Finn, the shareholder in Conoco Phillips, took note of the above and said he would present it at the company's next shareholders' meeting in New York City on October 5.
It remains to be seen what results will be achieved by the activities of the representatives of the Water Committee in Lima from 24 to 27 September.

Peru: Monocultures are endangering water in Iquitos
This is the third and final part of a series of three posts on the water problem in Iquitos city.
See the first and second.
In the first post of this series we introduced the water problem in Iquitos and the controversy generated by the exploration and search for hydrocarbons by the transnational Conoco Phillips in the Nanay River basin.
In the second post we delve into the Conoco Phillips case, showing also the actions that organizations like the Water Committee are taking to protect the river and the water supply for Iquitos.
In this third and final post we focus on monocultures in the Nanay River and the controversy that causes the issue between those who support this type of crops and those who advise against them.
This fight for water in Iquitos is not without risks.
The researcher at the IIAP (Institute of Research of the Peruvian Amazon), José Álvarez, published an article entitled "Monocultures in the Nanay?
No, thank you", where he pointed out the reasons of the IIAP to discourage the cultivation of oil palm in the Nanay basin, especially in the basin of the Curaca ravine, tributary of the Nanay, adjacent to the area of amortization of the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve.
- The Nanay basin is the source of drinking water for the population of Iquitos and surrounding areas, and any serious alteration of vegetation cover can jeopardize the supply of this vital element, both in quantity and quality.
Industrial oil palm plantations, in addition to involving the clearing of large areas of native forests, require high inputs of agrochemicals and therefore pose a serious threat of water pollution. - The areas where palm plantations are planned are entirely covered by very little altered primary forests, which have barely undergone minimal selective extraction of some woody and wildlife species.
It is the policy of the Peruvian State, and a formal commitment to the international community, to protect the Amazon primary forests, as a measure to reduce carbon emissions and to contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change.

Published under Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) But this apparently did not sit well with some, who organized a group of people, allegedly peasants  from the area, who went out to demonstrate in favor of the cultivation of the oil palm  and at the same time attacking the researcher José Álvarez, carrying banners where you could read things like trafficant of natural resources  and were asked to be expelled from the national territory.
In a statement in support of the investigator, a group of citizens from Iquitos said that conversing with the protesters, they said they had been informed that Álvarez "was the culprit of not promoting the cultivation of palm and not approving the government credits for this purpose", which makes them think that the origin of these attacks would be close to the regional authorities.
Not all opinions are against the cultivation of oil palm in the Nanay basin.Economist Victor Villavicencio la Torre, who served as Regional Manager for Economic Development of the Loreto Regional Government, is in favor and writes:
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, but I am not sure that we can accept them.
This alliance must take out of the political game those NGOs which receive and administer money from countries which, let us say, are the first to attack the environment and biodiversity of many nations in the world.
He then reiterates what he believes the role of the state should be:
The State must set itself as an immediate goal to review the laws regulating agricultural and forestry activity, to tear the progres  flags that display these  caviars  from the environment and stop being passive spectators of the aggressive actions they develop.... we find a point of convergence that prevents the people of the countryside, tired of so many promises of change, end up burning the prairie and bringing to collective memory the fatal events of Cajamarca, Espinar, Madre de Dios and Bagua.
Is that what we want?
In response, the aforementioned researcher Biologist José Álvarez, published another article entitled "Chronic Underdevelopmentism" in which he argues the following:
They say conservationists have spent tens of millions on projects funded by foreign thugs who seek to slow down the development of our region.
The big question is: did anyone prevent the promotion of agriculture and livestock farming, without restrictions, in the communities of Loreto during these years in the jungle?
No, I'm not going to.
But the entrepreneurs are still very interested in the business opportunities that represent the 620,00 hectares of the Loreto region, which according to the ministry of agriculture are available for seedling, and do work of dissemination about it.
Academics and researchers continue to provide data and studies on the danger that oil palm cultivation poses to the fragile Amazon ecosystem.
They even denounce that companies are promoting the consideration of oil palm plantations as reforestation activity, as well as the incentives the government gives to such cultivation.
Even President Ollanta Humala in a recent press conference mentioned an Amazon area, the Alto Huallaga, as having "potential for agro-industry, for coffee, for cocoa, for oil palm for fruit planting".
On the one hand, there are those who promote large-scale investment and on the other, those who defend the environment, making the problem worse by the fact that the dialogue on this subject is not exactly abundant, as is the clear and transparent information that citizens need.

Chile: Twitter welcomes Mexican president-elect with a "vete"
On Thursday, September 20, 2012 the President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, began his visit to Chile, the fourth country in his first tour of Central and South American nations.
After a private dinner with President Sebastián Piñera, on Friday morning he had a meeting with Chile's leading businessmen and later made an official visit to the Palace of the Mint.
Peña Nieto thanked for the hospitality through his Twitter account (@EPN):
@EPN: I thank President @sebastianpinera for his hospitality and productive meeting.
Our relationship with Chile will remain strategic.
However, not all was talk, handshakes and protocol. #YoSoy132-Chile members denounced the arrest of six of their colleagues  one of them of Mexican origin  for protesting in the Plaza de La Moneda against the visit of the elected president.
Mexican netizens responded to this tag, generating an exchange that led to the tag becoming a trending topic.
Here are some of them:
Chilean Max Barata (@MaxBarata) commented with humor:
Image shared by @YoSoy132chile on Twitter
@MaxBarata: Pinera and Peña Nieto.
Lex Luthor and Darth Vader are missing, and we're putting "summit" on it.
While Chascas Valenzuela (@elchascas) imagined the meeting between the two leaders:
@elchascas: A dialogue between Peña Nieto and Piñera should be like a comedy sketch.
The two of you talking about poverty, helicopters and golf at the same time.
The parody account of journalist Carmen Aristegui (@Aristegui_CNN) said:
@Aristegui_CNN: #VetedeChilePeñaNieto No! I'm not going to be able to get out of here.
Tell him to stay there!
From Mexico, the Legal and Human Rights Committee 132 (@ComiteDH132) made this comparison:
@ComiteDH132: If anything, the only difference between Pinochetism and Prism is that here, in fact, the dictatorship was perfect... #VeteDeChilePeñaNieto
While Gaby (@Gigi_091) denounced:
@Gigi_091: The protests in Chile against Peña Nieto Are they not news Televisa either? but if it is news a blackout in the Chamber of Deputies...
And Enrique J. Bautista (@kmach02) from Tabasco, Mexico spoke about the union felt by some netizens from both countries through this online protest:
@kmach02: #VetedeChilePeñaNieto and that day Chile and Mexico felt more like brothers than ever... they fighting for education and we for Taxation

10 things you should not prevent because of copyright (infographic)
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
In the digital world, where barriers to access to information, knowledge and culture have significantly decreased, intellectual property can become an obstacle to freedom of expression (we explain it here, and we saw it, for example, in the testimonial of Smart Citizen).
In this new infographic, we want to be explicit in that you know 10 of the common things we do on the Internet that shouldn't be prevented by intellectual property.
The problem is that, absurd as it may seem, many of them are common targets for certain particular interests of the copyright industry.
Know your rights, exercise them and defend them.
In that way, you are also defending the Internet. #NoThemasaInternet

China: Protesters arrested for banners of human rights in protest against Japan
More and more people believe that the weekend of anti-Japanese protests in over 80 cities are state-sponsored.
The arrest of three peaceful protesters in Shenzhen among thousands of anti-Japanese protesters shows how effectively and selectively the police were controlling and directing the demonstration.
According to the NGO news website canyu.org, three human rights activists were arrested on September 16 this year during the anti-Japanese demonstration:
(Canyu News on September 16) This morning a big anti-Japanese demonstration was held in the center of Shenzhen near Huaqiang North and the Civic Center.
Shenzhen Democrats such as Jiang Weidong, Ziyuan dared to express their aspirations for freedom, democracy and human rights.
They were discovered by the secret police and arrested around 1 p.m.
They've been out of touch since then, their phones are off.
Our contact phone number is 15167233712
Three Shenzhen human rights activists, who were quickly arrested by the secret police, demonstrate in favor of democracy in a protest against Japan.
Photos from canyu.com
The above data somehow echoes Custers' observations about the role of the police in the anti-Japanese protest:
Like many people around the world, I have spent the last few days looking at photos and reports about anti-Japanese demonstrations in China.
For those who are interested, here is an excellent collection of them.
For those who have been to a demonstration in China before, you will be inclined to say: where are the despicable police?...
Now, we'll compare photos of the "Jasmine Revolution" protest in Beijing, an incident so small that not only was there no car-overturning, no fire or rioting, there were even no protesters.
There was an army of cops there...
The evidence is overwhelming that China is ignoring these protests.
China's absence of police forces is clearly evident, especially in contrast to the large number that circulates and starts to jump in front of the destroyed lenses and cameras whenever an unforeseen protest displeases the Chinese government.
China has clearly shown that, if it wants to, it is quite capable of keeping a protest against Japan under control.
The obvious conclusion  the only conclusion now  is that you don't want it.
Paraguay: Internet providers block news site without authorization
Cyber users in Paraguay.

An alarming act of censorship by private companies took place on September 26th in Paraguay.
Two Internet Service Providers (ISPs) blocked the AbcColor.me website without a court order
Clarification by AbcColor.me
The controversial website is a user-generated content platform similar to the local newspaper ABC Color.
Any user can upload news (fake news and satire are welcome) as well as photos related to the news.
Once the content is uploaded, the article looks similar to the ABC Color newspaper, but has a footnote that says the site contains fake news and user-generated content.
TEDIC reported on the situation and criticized the ISP move as a violation of consumer rights and an act against the principles of net neutrality and consumer rights.
When users tried to access the site from the Internet service provider Tigo they received a warning informing them that they were being redirected since the company had classified the site as one containing malicious software and therefore simply denied access.
He was also blocked from cell phones.
After netizens were outraged and upset by this clear act of censorship by a private company, increased pressure on Twitter and even the Argentine Pirate Party expressed concern, Internet service providers unblocked the website.
Tigo Paraguay did not apologize or give any explanations to users, they simply unblocked the site.
With the presidential elections approaching in April 2013, and after the indictment of former President Lugo, online freedom of expression is a sensitive and vulnerable issue in a deeply divided country where political instability worries many.
Now Paraguayans know that their Internet service providers have the technology to quickly censor sites and are eager to do so.
As consumers and citizens, they should be asking themselves all sorts of questions.

What do we want the figure to be in 2012? To achieve jointly 0 violent deaths for 24 hours in all municipalities of the country "
Through Twitter, several citizens told in real time what was happening and expressed their optimism for the initiative.
Musician César López (@CesarLopezmusic), one of the leaders of the initiative, posted:
@CesarLopezmusic: Our children may say many things about us but never that we didn't try. @24_0 @24_0 Guatemala @240puertorico

On Sunday, September 30, supporters of Henrique Capriles demonstrated in the streets of Caracas during the closing of the presidential candidate's campaign.
Capriles is running against current President Hugo Chávez in the upcoming October 7 presidential election.
Daniel Duquenal wrote on his blog Venezuela News and Views:
I'm not ready to put "political event" because some confused revolutions could bring a lot of people into the streets.
I can assure you something, from previous experiences in Venezuela, today Capriles has put at least a million and a half people on the streets of Caracas. for hours, people tried to come and go, or just walk a part of the different established routes.

Venezuela: Twitter manual for citizen election coverage
Reporte Ya (@reporteya), a training initiative by the Miguel Otero Silva Foundation, has launched a handbook on Twitter use for citizens reporting during the upcoming presidential election in Venezuela on October 7, 2012.
The manual is available online, in PDF format, on the website of the newspaper El Nacional.
The manual - written by journalist, blogger, and Global Voices contributor Luis Carlos Diaz - states:
On election day, social media will be a reflection of our participatory spirit, but it will also serve to record what is happening in almost every corner of the country.
That is why it is important to have some criteria for election coverage and monitoring.
The aim of this handbook is to provide some premises for reducing noise and rumors, producing reliable information and networking for citizen reporting.
Twitter manual for citizen election coverage
The manual is based on questions like "Why are we going to use Twitter?", "How do I upload photos/videos to Twitter?", "How do I monitor information during elections?", "How do I avoid rumors?" and more.
The manual also instructs citizen reporters in case of communication failure, listing three possible scenarios: collapse of mobile networks, collapse of Twitter platform, and blocking of internet access.
To answer the question "What #tag will we use?", the manual recommends using #7O or #ElectionsVE, "although they will change throughout the day depending on Twitter users' discussions and reactions to election events".

Turkey: Thousands protest in Istanbul against war with Syria
The Turkish army attacked Syrian targets in response to the killing of five Turkish civilians by Syrian government forces.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's office issued a statement immediately afterwards, saying:
Our armed forces in the border region immediately responded to this abhorrent attack in accordance with their rules of engagement; targets were hit by artillery fire at sites in Syria identified by radar.
The Turkish parliament has approved a one-year mandate authorizing cross-border military action.
The motion was passed by 320 votes in the 550-seat Turkish parliament.
Turkey's deputy prime minister has said in a statement that authorising the use of force in Syria does not amount to a declaration of war, but acts as a preventive measure.
This was followed by a statement by the Prime Minister of Turkey saying:
All we want in this region is peace and security.
We have no intention of starting a war.
We are aware of the results, the consequences, of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We see the same in Syria.
The Syrian state news agency (SANA) immediately issued a statement saying that the Syrian authorities offered their deepest condolences to the families of the dead and the Turkish people.
More than 5,000 protesters took to the streets of Istanbul against a possible war with Syria.
On Thursday night, the demonstration was against the AKP, and the protesters chanted,
The AKP wants war, the people want peace.
Not to war, peace now.
A poster at the Istanbul anti-war protest saying No to intervention in Syria, shared by @Cherine_89 on Twitter.
Re-released with permission.
In Turkey, the slogan Savasa hayir, which means "no to war", became the trending topic among Twitter users on Thursday morning.
And since the mandate for cross-border military action has been passed, social media has been divided over the issue, creating a firestorm of opinions from activists, experts and the like.
From Turkey, Hulya Ataoglu tweeted:
@cramelin: #savasahayir #notowar No to war, not now and never.
Ozgur Gurbuz, from Istanbul, says:
@ozzgurbuz: Peace is the only way #noWar #savasahayir from Istanbul.
More and more here.

Costa Rica: Advances in wildlife protection laws
On October 10, 2012, President Laura Chinchilla signed a decree that strengthens the controls against fluttering in the region.
Although fin fishing in Costa Rica has been banned since 2001, some loopholes in current legislation allowed the marketing of shark fins.
The purpose of the decree is to make illegal the importation of shark fins into the country to prevent their sale and export.
The news was greeted with great joy by ecologists, non-governmental organizations and hundreds of citizens who had sent letters to the Executive Power of the Republic to raise awareness about a terrible and painful practice.
Carol Corrales puts it this way in a post she wrote for Rainforest Radio:
Shark fining is a devastating and cruel practice, where sharks are mutilated to remove their fins, and then returned to the sea without them, where the animal dies after suffering a terrible agony.

Favorable comments about the signing became visible on Twitter under the hashtag #NOALALETEO.
Such is the case of Marianela Castro (@necascru) who tweeted:
@necascru: #noalaleteo Zero tolerance to fluttering! the law is obeyed!
Up the creatures of our seas!
Free life to our biodiversity! #CR
But this is not the only good news for Costa Ricans about wildlife protection.
On October 2, the legislative plenary approved in first debate the reform of the law on Conservation of Wildlife that proposes the abolition of sport hunting in the country.
The project was promoted by the Association Preservationist of Flora and Fauna (Apreflofas) and if approved in second debate, Costa Rica would be the first nation in Latin America to penalize this practice.
This project was supported by citizens who, with over 177 thousand signatures, were an important defence of the law.
Under the slogan Hunting is Killing  it was possible to mobilize a large number of supporters for the popular initiative which is the first at the national level to reach the Congress.
The blog Generación Rebelde  describes the event as  a celebration for wildlife  and ends a post about the news with the following sentence:
We celebrate.
We are prepared to be vigilant so that any attempt to repeal it is rejected and that it is carried out to the letter.
The congressmen who opposed the bill in the first debate received heavy criticism.
This is what Susan wrote on Maecr's blog:
In Costa Rica, killing wild animals for food? In the Stone Age maybe. The matter of sport hunting and its interests, is what among the word-for-word probably tries to hide.
Elections are coming, maybe most of them don't feel so close, but it's important to reflect and decide well who we give power to, which subjects will sit comfortably, with good salaries to choose and decide for ALL the others
Tweets about the law can be read under the hashtag #LeydeVidaSilvestre.

Chile: I'm in Dicom : new video on copyright
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
English translator's note: Dicom is a credit reporting agency in Chile owned by Equifax.
The phrase estoy en Dicom" is commonly used by Chileans to indicate that they have a debt report.
The case of the film I'm on Dicom  is extremely illustrative of how intellectual property can affect freedom of expression, by bringing together two at least curious legal actions: on the one hand, Equifax, the company that owns Dicom, is trying to revoke the domain estoyendicom.cl, because the film would be taking customers away from their product.
And on the other hand, according to this company, I'm in Dicom  would already exist, because it would be the name of a literary work that was previously registered by an Equifax worker.
Both actions, of course, were aimed at all costs at inhibiting the development and release of the work.
In this new #NoTemasaInternet video, the filmmakers of the film I'm on Dicom  tell us why they are not afraid of the Internet, describing these legal actions and how, despite Equifax's attempts, they are confident that their right to free speech prevails over the copyright reasons cited in the case.
Bahrain: Four Twitter users detained
According to Bahrain's Interior Ministry, "four Twitter users have been arrested for abuse on social media".
However, the charges mentioned in the report seem imprecise: defamation of public figures on social media.
Twitter users Ali Al-Haiki, Abdullah Al-Hashimi, Ali Mohamed and Salman Abdullah will be in custody for the seven days of the investigation.
Although the Bahraini authorities claim that the constitution protects freedom of expression, there have been cases where activists have been arrested simply for exercising their right to express themselves on social media such as Twitter.
If the four detainees are arrested for exercising their right to freedom of expression they should be considered prisoners of conscience.
Updates will be published later.
Panama: President Martinelli tours country after repeal of Law 72
Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli tried to close a chaotic week with a conciliatory speech that invited people to seek peace after the violent clashes in Colón in protest of Law 72.
The law allowed the sale of land located in the free (tax) zone of Columbus.
The press conference was broadcast on a national network on Sunday, October 28 before a population waiting to see what the first president might say after a silence only interrupted by two brief tweets.
Telemetro summarizes some phrases from the presidential speech:
"I have a sad heart, for the lives lost, the wounded, and the goods looted, sad because instead of moving forward we are going backwards" were part of the words of the president who expressed that a Law was abrogated whose explanation did not reach everyone.
He stressed that "violence must never be the way to resolve our differences, for the good of the country and the Panamanians, these confrontations cannot be
During the speech, on social networks some Panamanians demanded the resignation of the President, some mocked the absence of apologies, and others saw a real opportunity for peace.
For El Joe (@hilmerj28), for example, the president taught a lesson to his opponents by giving a conciliatory message to Panamanians:
@hilmerj28: "@gonzalezbmariac: Good message @rmartinelli showed conciliatory message Panama and the colonists!" sad the opposing lizards don't you think?
But for others like Zeus Delgarte (@ZeusDelgarte) the speech was too short:
@ZeusDelgarte: I should have done twettcam
The president's minister Roberto Henriquez (@RCHENRIQUEZ) sees in the speech sincerity and the opportunity for reconciliation:
@RCHENRIQUEZ: Law 72 repealed.
Martinelli, what's going on?
Now we're going to organize the dialogue with Columbus' living forces.
Opposition MP Beby Valderrama (@BebyValderrama) believes the speech is simply an opportunity to wipe the face of the government and not apologize:
@BebyValderrama: 9 days, 192 hours, 11,520 minutes and 691,200 seconds 4 dead, + 42 wounded and in 5 min he wants to muddy everyone and he doesn't apologize
While the speech called for reconciliation, the reactions on social media have been mixed and diverse.
Perhaps this is not the last chapter of this controversial law.

Libya: Is it true that Khamis Gaddafi is dead?
This article is part of our special coverage Libya Revolution 2011.
Is Khamis Gaddafi dead?
Really dead?
The journalist Mary Fitzgerald tweeted:
@MaryFitzgeraldIT: After a day of rumors, the spokesperson of #Libya's national congress has declared on a local TV channel that Khamis, Gaddafi's son had been captured and wounded and died today
@MaryFitzgeraldIT: Given that Khamis, Gaddafi's son has been reported kidnapped or killed on different occasions over the last 20 months, it is not surprising that many are waiting to see the evidence #Libya
The Libyan Youth Movement stated:
@ShababLibya: We will wait until we see photos and keep you updated on this.
We all thought he was already dead! #Libya
And Huda adds:
@hudduh: Khamis has died more times than Kenny.
Waiting for the inevitable video to confirm his capture/death. #Libya
NPR strategist Andy Carvin tweeted:
@acarvin: Show us Khamis Gaddafri. He is a very good man.
Try it.
Until then, he will remain a Kayser Soze. #Libya
Meanwhile, Iyad El-Baghdadi predicted:
@iyad_elbaghdadi: Someone despicable has created and circulated a photoshoped image of Khamis dead #Gaddafi in 3...
2... #Libya
And from Libya, AletheiaLibya commented:
@AletheiaLibya: If #Gaddafi "lives forever in the hearts of Libyans", it is only fair that Moussa Ibrahim and Khamis also live forever in #Libya prisons
Moussa Ibrahim was the spokesman for Gaddafi.
News reports claim he was captured in Tarhouna, south of the capital, Tripoli.
Journalist Jenan Moussa appealed to reason:
@jenanmoussa: Guys, guys, stop spreading rumors.
I confirm that no one in #Libya can confirm anything at the moment about Khamis Gaddafi
Only time will tell if Khamis Gaddafi will soon achieve the same fate as his father.

The destruction of Syria in photos
This post is part of our special coverage Protests in Syria 2011/12.
Syrian photographers around the world are revealing, sharing and storing the uprising in Syria through photographs that show the destruction.
Despite limited media coverage, what comes out of Syria shows the terrible reality Syrians face as they see their country literally destroyed.
Although there are no reliable sources to confirm the locations of the photographs or the number of casualties, the following images are a sample to give you an idea of how Syria's infrastructure and residential areas have been affected.
Among hundreds of photographers, Yazan Homsy shares with us scenes of the destruction of Homs.
He describes himself as:
@YazanHomsY: Yazan Homsy, son of the great Homs, activist of the Syrian revolution, from Khalidya neighborhood.
Revolution to victory or martyrdom.
He has posted his pictures on his Facebook to illustrate the destruction of buildings in the city of Homs.
Homs: 139-day siege of 14 buildings in the city.
Six months and the Assad militias used explosives and missiles of all kinds to destroy the besieged neighborhood of Homs.

Bolivia: Vice President tracks down insults from netizens
"I often log in and write down the names and surnames of those who insult the president (Evo Morales)", said Álvaro García Linera, vice president of Bolivia, on October 20, 2012.
Although opposition members considered this comment to be an attempt to restrict freedom of expression in the country, the government minister, Carlos Romero, said that "social media is usually misused to attack the government or to give false information about its work".
Netizens had different reactions to this news.
Twitter user Juan Carlos Quiroga (@jcrquiroga) highlighted the positive side of the vice president's comment:

@jcrquiroga: I liked that Vice talked about social networks, because for the first time we know that he is interested in social networks. @joup1
However, Mr. García Linera does not have an official website, user profile or Facebook or Twitter account, the two most popular social networks in Bolivia.
On the other hand, Mario Durán (@mrduranch), a Twitter user from El Alto, Bolivia, implied that the government is not handling the situation:
@mrduranch: the blue idea (referring to the ruling party, MAS) to control social media allows "bad things"... with that logic we should eliminate kitchen knives #fb
Other netizens are calling on the government to address the problems and needs of Bolivians.
Fabiola Chambi (@fabiolachambi) commented on her Twitter:
@fabiolachamb: That Vice and his "trackers" also write down the complaints and needs of netizens.
There are other places where people are demonstrating!
The vice president's comment and the reactions of citizens (both on and off the Internet) have rekindled the debate about social media control in Bolivia.
On the Facebook page of Democratic Governance, a platform focused on extending democratic exchange in the country, Miriam Romero Baldiviezo expressed her support for the restrictive measures, especially to solve problems such as pornography and crime, as well as to legislate on the use and access to the Internet.
In response to Miriam Romero's comment, some activists consider such control measures unfeasible due to a series of restrictions; for example, most Bolivians connect to the Internet from cafes and other public spaces, so the same IP address is assigned to different users.
Bolivia: Radio journalists burned in Yacuiba
Bolivian radio journalist Fernando Vidal and radio technician Karen Arce of Radio Popular in Yacuiba, a town on the Bolivian border with Argentina, were attacked by four masked men on Monday, October 29, 2012.
The men threw oil bombs inside the station, poured gasoline on Vidal and set him on fire.
Arce was also injured in the attack.
Vidal, manager and owner of the radio station, and Arce are being treated for their burns as the investigation into the arson attack progresses.
Early theories suggest that the attack may have been related to Vidal's open criticism of corruption and smuggling.
Vidal's son-in-law, journalist Esteban Farfán Romero, has been actively reporting on the journalist's health and the news of the case.
On Monday, October 29, Farfán reported on Facebook:
We're working on rebuilding the radio.
Right now we're taking out everything burned to get back in the air like Don Fernando Vidal told us before we left for Santa Cruz.
So I left the radio after the bombing.
On October 31, Farfan (@EstebanFarfanR) tweeted the latest report on the arrests:
Vidal believes two government officials from Tarija department are behind the attack.
The Minister of the Interior, Carlos Romero, supports the theory.
The attack was clearly designed to stop Vidal's show, which that day was dedicated to discussing local smuggling cases.
Farfan confirmed that the family shares this theory on their Facebook account.
The Reporters Without Borders article adds:
As ex-mayor of Yacuiba and municipal councillor, Vidal has never hesitated to denounce corruption in the Tarija department and has always criticized the way public funds have been handled at the national and regional level, where they have increased significantly now that the Chaco region is earning more than 100 million dollars a year from the sale of its natural gas.
The Bolivian government, the United Nations and several news organizations have condemned the attack.
Farfan also reports that Yacuiba citizens marched to demand justice and shares photos of the march on Twitter:
March in Yacuíba, October 30, 2012 and the following day.

Puerto Rico: Another way to look up
Enrique Arce, a Puerto Rican street artist and photographer, known as Aslan, has been posting photos of planes on his Instagram account for over six months as part of his #above series.
The project aims to engage with the community through the "Scavenger Hunt" challenge detailed on their blog.
Selections from the series are printed and pasted onto tiles and then nailed to walls and buildings throughout San Juan.
The lucky ones who find those tiles first and send a photo to Aslan with their location, win a copy of the tile that they can keep.
In a recent interview published by Global Voices, Aslan says: "I started to gather at the beginning without a clear reason.
It wasn't until I decided to work on the series that I realized that this exploration could lead to a different kind of artistic creation that could draw attention.
It is interesting to see how simple ideas like looking up (or "p'arriba") and photographing an airplane are the ones that attract more people".
Below you will find ten of my favorite photos of planes from the giant #above series - which has over 600 photographs to date!
The photos are reproduced with permission of the artist.
Follow Aslan as he continues to gather more photos through Twitter and his blog.
The following paintings are from Aslan's collection of Creatures in Limbo, presented here to show some of the artist's other work.

Arab world: Obama and Romney share views on Syria
After waiting until late in the morning to tune in to the latest US presidential debate (before the November elections) between President Obama and Republican hopeful Mitt Romney, Arab netizens ended up sharing a series of harsh comments online.
On Twitter, netizens lashed out at US policy regarding Syria saying that both Obama and Romney were two sides of the same coin.
Abu Hatem tweeted:
@abuhatem: As far as Syria is concerned, Romney and Obama are exactly the same.
Ahmed Shihab-Eldin added:
@ASE: He has no different ideas, so we are doing exactly what we are supposed to do. #Obama shares Romney's plans for #Syria #Debate
What is Obama's position on Syria?
Shared through the Facebook page "The New Syria"
And the Facebook page of "The New Syria" said:
It seems as if #Obama and #Romney are more concerned about #Syria becoming a "allied" of the United States in the long run than trying to help the civilians there.
We don't need your help, Allah is on our side.
"THE 47th" noted:
@THE_47th: So Obama wants to see what Israel wants to do in Syria (with or without intervention).
Romney thinks Syria is an opportunity.
30,000 dead is an opportunity.
At the same time, Syrian Amal Hanano addressed Obama:
@AmalHanano: Obama, you don't need to visit the Holocaust Museum to remember the devil.
Turn on YouTube and look at the blood of #Syria.
Sami Ben Romdhane from Tunisia tweeted:
@THE_47th: The winner today has been Twitter without a doubt.
Continuing the controversy, Tunisian blogger Ahmed Medien added:
As someone who might be affected by the same kind of policies and corporations between the US and MENA, I was not particularly impressed.

Ecuador fights against violence in sports
'Guayaquil without sporting violence' is the name of a campaign that seeks to eradicate violence in football and stadiums, after a confrontation between Barcelona and Emelec fans (both professional football teams and protagonists of the "Classic of the Shipyard") took place on November 4, leaving the 20-year-old George Murillo Leónde dead.
National and international media covered the confrontation.
Representatives of the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Sport, Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF), National Assembly, and clubs Emelec and Barcelona have begun work to neutralize acts of violence generated by fans and supporters of first division football teams.
After reaching an agreement, the parties have made public "The Ten Commandments Against Violence in Football" on the website of the Ministry of Interior.

Through social networks, under the hashtag #NoMasViolencia, people from different parts of the country express their concern about sports violence.
Football fans, like @michael_cse and @Sandtolo, reject the aggression and violence:
@michael_cse: For the passion of the team you not only kill a citizen KILL A FAMILY and mourn the country #NoMoreViolence #Let's make a difference..
@Sandtolo: I repudiate violence in all its forms, violence only comes from despotism and egocentrism:) #nomasviolence
Similarly, user @ANDRESL9 says:
@ANDRESL9: Football is a party we should live in peace. #noviolenceinstadiums.

Authorities and citizens hope that new proposals like 'Guayaquil without sport violence' will reach schools, marginal areas, and even hospitals and mobile clinics, as football is one of the few sports that moves masses across the country, especially in cities like Quito and Guayaquil.
Latin American youths against corruption
On November 5-6, 2012, more than 100 young journalists, leaders, and experts in social media and information and communication technologies (ICT) participated in the 3rd Voices Against Corruption Forum, organized by the Global Anti-Corruption Network (GYAC) in Brasilia, Brazil.
Andrea Arzaba (author of Global Voices) reports on the Latin American youth session for Animal Político:
Freedom of expression, lack of regional unity and fear of talking about issues of government transparency were some of the most discussed topics at the Latin American youth session.
Andrea also shares a video showing some projects for transparency and accountability led by young Latin Americans.
Along with Piero Locatelli, Andrea interviewed Margarita Valdés from Xpressate (El Salvador), Caio Monteiro from Marília Transparente (Brazil), and Andrea Benavides from Ocasa (Colombia):

The top 10 global parodies of "Gangnam Style"
It's no surprise that this viral video has inspired countless users to create their own.
Here we show you the top 10 Gangnam Style parodies selected from a series of meme videos.
To start with, Gangnam Style within politics:
The first.
The Gangnam style protest by Ai Weiwei
One of the last Gangnam dancers is the famous Chinese artist/activist Ai Weiwei.
However, he did not forget to convey his message against censorship by wearing handcuffs and changing the video title to "Grass Mud Horse" (click here for more information)

The third.
The Bolivian Gangman Style
Gangnam Style has even reached the political landscape of Bolivia.
A YouTube user, KwonBanYa, uploaded a video showing President Evo Morales and Vice President Álvaro García Linera, with brief appearances of some members of the ruling party and the opposition.
+ Gangman Style at the UN
Technically, it's not a video meme, but it's worth watching.

And now, some of the strangest parodies:
4.
The Penitentiary Style
Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center is known for using choreography within the process of rehabilitating prisoners.
Watch this startling video of dozens of prisoners in orange suits galloping in unison.
- It's five.
The Style of the Rescuers
Having fun and fooling around seems harmless, but not in certain places, especially if it's your workplace.
After a group of lifeguards from El Monte, California, put up this parody at the Gangman Style in municipal pool uniforms, 14 people were fired.
Psy himself, the K-Pop sensation, asked to be given their jobs back.
The city council recently decided to re-hired them.

Brunei would be one of the last places where South Koreans would expect to hear Gangman Style.
But here we have it, a hilarious video meme brought in from the other side of the world.
I got 10.
Gangnam Style of the Marines
A group of U.S. Naval Academy Marines sing the song of Psy galloping in their white uniforms.
Unlike fired lifeguards, these marine guards had the consent of the Navy.

Blogging the aftermath of the earthquake from Huitán, Guatemala
Rural communities in Guatemala were badly affected by the strong 7.4-magnitude earthquake that struck the country's Pacific coast on November 7, 2012.
The blog of the Mi Nuevo Mundo Community Library - part of Rising Voices' Xela Civic Libraries beneficiary project, located in the municipality of Huitán in the department of Quetzaltenango - has been sharing photos and reports of the impact the earthquake has had on families living in this rural area of Guatemala.
In a blog post published on November 10, community librarian Roman Díaz Castañón reported that several houses collapsed and several families were left homeless in an area called Huitancito in Huitán:
The families are crying for this disaster, they are in extreme poverty and they are going through an alarming situation, there has not been any aid from institutions like groceries, food, we need your help.

Two days later, Roman reported that on Sunday, November 11, the Riecken Guatemala Foundation and the community library had provided assistance to ten families affected by the earthquake in Huitancito, Huitán.
The blog post noted that the community still needed help with food, kitchen utensils, blankets and house building.
Roman added that 100 families were affected by the earthquake and 20 lost their homes.

Later that day, a short blog post reported that government aid had arrived on November 12.
The blog will keep readers informed about food distribution among others.

Guatemala has suffered several aftershocks since November 7, including a magnitude 6.5 earthquake.
The official death toll in the country is 42 victims.
Bangladesh: Investigation into journalist murder turns into farce
On that day, then Interior Minister Sahara Khatun declared that the culprit would be arrested within 48 hours.
When this deadline expired, some bloggers and journalists started a series of protests about it, but there was no progress in the investigation.
Recently there have been changes in the post of minister, with Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Almgir taking charge of the matter.
Sagar and Runi, the couple killed.
Image courtesy: Facebook page "We demand justice for Sagar-Runi" More than eight months have passed since the murder, but there has been no notable progress within the investigation.
According to his promise, just a day earlier he announced the arrest of seven suspects.
The suspects have criminal records and have been arrested previously for murder.
A million takas (Bangladeshi currency, equivalent to about $10,000) was offered for the missing doorman.
Initially, the police detained him for questioning, but the victims' relatives claim that 3 people took him and he remains missing.
There are many journalists who do not accept the minister's statements.
After the murder, Runi's younger brother, Nowser Roman, filed a complaint at Sher-e-Bangla police station.
On October 10, he posted on his Facebook page:
Thinking about myself, I'm amazed at how helpless we are!!
My family and I are very unhappy... I feel sorry for myself.
And Megh, my family and all those people being questioned, my heart breaks for them, for their parents and helpless couples...
Does God not exist???
Does God not exist???
(Quoted with permission)
Nowsher Roman was present at the protest of bloggers in front of the ministry on May 15, 2012.
The mother of Sagar Sarwar, the murdered journalist, believes the arrests are a setup and said "We just want to know the truth, we want to see the real culprits behind bars".
On April 28, 2012, some bloggers started a street painting protest over the couple's death.
The report was published by the BBC.
Asif Nazrul, a professor at the law department of Dhaka University posted on his Facebook page: "We ask for justice for Sagar and Runi":
There are two conspiracy theories about this murder.
The first: they exposed the great corruption within the government and they were killed for it.
The second is that the killers are linked to the ruling parties.
Who works in the background?
What was the motive for the murder?
How are the eight suspects connected to the case and how were they identified?
I want to know all these answers.
(Published with permission).
Journalist Shawkat Mahmud posted on 26 September 2012 on his Facebook page:
Since 1971, 29 journalists have been killed murdered (in this country).
In addition, 17 have died during this term.
Many journalists have been injured while working and are frequently threatened.
The government has created a cloud around the investigation of the Sagar-Runi case.
The Interior Minister claimed after the murder that the killers would be jailed within 48 hours.
The Inspector General of Police said that significant progress is being made in the investigation, but police officers claim that evidence has been destroyed.
And we're going on with the protests.
Success of the Cairo metro strike
The subway has returned to Egypt after a four-hour strike.
Train services, which carry up to 2 million people a day in Cairo, came to a complete halt when drivers stopped working in protest against the chairman of the metro board, who is accused of corruption.
Workers also demand better wages and working conditions.
On Twitter, netizens applauded the strike, giving their support to what they described as the workers' legitimate demands.
Salma El Tarzi pays tribute to the metro workers for the success of the strike.
He writes:
@Salma_El_Tarzi:Congratulations to the Metro strikers! The people affected by the strike should have a problem with the government and not with the workers who went on strike to demand their rights
Mona Seif shares a similar thought:
@Monasosh: Those affected by the metro strike should go and find a way to have their demands met, so they can return to their jobs.
And Ola Shahba calls for more support for the metro workers:
@OlaShahba: The metro strike is an example of workers who know how to hurt the government and force it to negotiate when they realize that the service they provide cannot be stopped for long.
We must support them so that they do not give in to pressure
Dina Samak compares the success of the metro workers' strike to the lack of attention faced by the ongoing doctors' strike in Egypt.
@dinasamak: The metro strike was an immediate success because stopping transport hurts capitalism.
But the doctors' strike continues because the ruler still doesn't care about the poor.
The solution lies in solidarity among all.
Egyptian doctors have been on partial strike since October 1.
And Nermeen Bedair adds that:
@Nermbed: My medical friends on Facebook (both pro and anti-strike) suggest that doctors ask the metro workers to add the doctors' demands to their own
While Mohamed Shawkuy comments:
@shawkination: Metro drivers went on strike which brought the country to a complete standstill.
After four hours, there are changes in the ministry.
Doctors have been on strike for 45 days and nobody pays attention because nobody's died.

Bolivia, do you have the Internet?
The 2012 National Population and Housing Census of Bolivia was held on November 21.
The last census was more than a decade ago, in December 2001.
Led by the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the 2012 national census aims to provide updated information on demographic, social, economic and housing conditions in the country, allowing to adjust, define and evaluate plans, programs, public policies and strategies for human, economic and social development at the national, departmental and municipal levels .
Focusing primarily on demographic and housing issues, the questionnaire used for the census has sparked a debate on social media platforms regarding question 17: Does this home have internet service?
However, the single question regarding internet access only informs about the service, without taking into account the type of connection, quality, usage, digital gap and so on, missing the opportunity to gather more in-depth information on this matter.
Nayeli and Carla from Safe the Children (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)
It is estimated that about 30% of the population and 9% of households have access to the internet in Bolivia.
The number is not high; however, the quality shows an even worse scenario: only 0.7 out of 100 have broadband connection.
Mario Durán, a blogger and activist living in El Alto, argues in his blog that question 17 should be answered as no if the internet access is via a mobile broadband device or mobile phone.
After sharing his position on social media platforms, a series of responses came in favor and against his argument.
Eliana Quiroz, a well-known digital activist, commented in an open discussion on the Facebook page campaign More bandwidth for Bolivia:
Adding more questions is expensive and since they don't consider the Internet connection to be strategic, they didn't include anything.
The question is as it is and so it is only to be answered.
For the next census I expect there will be a battery of questions about the Internet.
Despite the gaps in the census questions, Grover Yapura (@GroverYapura) states through his Twitter account:
@GroverYapura: #Census2012, there is only one option on the 21st: Be counted and help count #Bolivia
The mainstream media and citizens actively reported on the Bolivian National Census through the hashtags #Censo2012 and #CensoBo.
India: Dalits burned their homes for inter-caste marriage
On November 7 to 2000, three Dalit settlements in Tamil Nadu's Dharmapuri district were attacked by people, according to the International Dalit Solidarity Network (ISDN) based on sources from The Hindu, IBN, Times of India and Countercurrents.
According to newspapers, a nursing student from the Vanniyar (shudrá) community married a man from the Aadidravida (Dalit) community in Natham colony.
After her father committed suicide for dishonor, mobs were organized against the Dalit community.
According to ISDN, crowds arrived in large numbers in the afternoon, looted Dalits' homes and set fire to them with Molotov cocktails.
Hundreds of homes were damaged and 1,500 Dalits were left without shelter and belongings.
It remains open and ambiguous that the most violence against Dalits in Tamil Nadu was inflicted by thevars and vanniyars, two of the largest shudras communities run by different political parties".
According to IDSN, Henri Tiphagne, executive director of human rights organization Peoples Watch, (IDSN member) traveled to the area to assess the situation and offer help to the children and said: "It was the most shocking of the incidents of atrocities against castes I have seen in my life so far with regard to the effects of the incident - an inter-caste marriage that had been carried out with the knowledge and protection of the police that ended in violence with the attack on 430 houses".

Workshop: Digital media for endangered languages in Latin America
Rising Voices note: We are very happy to collaborate with this next event coming up in early 2013.
This is a republication of the original article in Spanish on the Living Tongues blog.
Durable Voices: A media technology workshop for speakers of endangered languages in Latin America.

When ideas die, we all become poor.
Half of the 7,000 languages on the planet are now in danger of extinction: a drastic change in human intellectual history.
The basis of human knowledge is enduring, and for 99% of human history it has been transmitted only by word of mouth.
However, it is fragile, largely unwritten and vulnerable to oblivion.
Digital technology can help document and preserve knowledge coded in these languages.
Objectives: to train 12 indigenous participants to learn how to create a register of their endangered languages, creating new linguistic materials such as audio-dictionaries through computers, cameras and audio recorders and other technologies.
(All training will be in Spanish.)
Programme: each day will be dedicated to a different activity on digital language documentation.

Colombia: Cali organizes its third Barcamp
On Monday 17 December, the third edition of Barcamp Cali will be held, an event of Free Culture organized in the city of Cali, Colombia, by DELM Cali and the Autonomous University of the West, and with the participation of some communities such as: Fosschix Colombia, Fundación Casa del Bosque, PrimeCom and Trueque Digital.
Here is an excerpt from the invitation posted on the event blog:
You may be wondering what a Barcamp is, it's very simple, it's a space where knowledge is shared in a free, open and participatory way, on topics related to ICT through voluntary talks called deconferences what there are are people willing to share what they know and also willing to listen to what you know.
The event has generated anticipation among Caleños netizens, who have been tweeting about it, like Luis RoDevia (@luisrodevia):
@NelsonAdrianF: Those who like to share software, art and cultural content can't miss #Barcampcali3 cc @barcampcalico
While Lina María (@LinaMaO) comments:
@LinaMaO: Hey how cool is Professor Julio going to @barcampcalico http://barcampcali.co/2012/el-profe-julio-presente-en-el-3er-barcamp-cali/ ... I can't imagine the math classes I've seen him do xD
She refers to the professor and engineer Julio Alberto Ríos Gallego from Caleño, better known as  Prof Julio  on YouTube, where he is very popular (almost a kind of star), and what is unusual, in a field as at first glance unattractive for users of that platform as is physics and mathematics.

Iran: Jailed lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh ends hunger strike after 49 days
Nasrin Sotoudeh, source: http://ahurai.com/social
The Iranian blogosphere has been filled with rejoicing after lawyer and prisoner of conscience Nasrin Sotoudeh reported that she ended her hunger strike, which had lasted for 49 days.
Multiple sources, including the Kaleme website affiliated with the opposition Green Movement, have quoted Nasrin Sotoudeh's husband Reza Khandan as saying that meetings with the Islamic Consultative Assembly (Parliament) and negotiations with the speaker of the Iranian Parliament and the head of the judiciary have resulted in the lifting of the travel ban imposed on their teenage daughter.
With her demand met, Nasrin Sotoudeh ended her hunger strike.
A very proud and happy Iranian blogger, Azadi Esteghlal Edalat (meaning Freedom, Independence and Justice) writes:
Signing to death against cruelty and injustice, and getting the whole world to join her battle against the injustice the regime was doing to her beloved daughter (Mehraveh), our beloved Narin Sotoudeh has ended her hunger strike now that the legal restrictions against Mehraveh have been lifted.
She taught the suffering Iranian people a lesson of hope and resilience.
Nasrin Sotoudeh is the lioness of Iran, the pride of every Iranian liberal.
Happy victory!
A picture of the Nasrin Sotoudeh support group on Facebook.
The legend says, "Your presence alone breaks the darkness".
Azadeghi praised Nasrin Sotoudeh's courage, and said:
It was the victory of the will of an Iranian woman against the Taliban regime.
Nasrin Sotoudeh should know that she was not alone, that many Iranians supported her.
Nasrin Sotoudeh speaks about the execution of minors
In this short interview (subtitled in English) Nasrin criticizes the Islamic Republic's judicial system, and calls on the regime to stop the execution of prisoners under the age of 18.
Global Voices and the power of us
Have you ever wondered how we do what we do at Global Voices?
Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how the more than 700 members of our diverse, global, and completely virtual community bring together the stories.
Every day, our section leaders, editors and volunteer authors and translators work together across borders, time zones and language barriers to bring out the best in citizen and social media, inform about free expression online and support others to join the global conversation.
To kick off the fundraising campaign for the holiday season, this analysis of how an article was made shows how the combined efforts of many people combine to make Global Voices so unique.
23 October 2012: João Miguel, from his home in Fortaleza, Brazil, sends an email to the distribution list of his fellow volunteer Portuguese team about an incident involving the Guarani kaiowá, Brazil's second largest ethnic group, who are under threat of eviction from their ancestral lands in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
Janet, in the UK, writes a short English post quickly, while six other group members in five different cities in Brazil, Portugal and Spain get to work and research the story.
24 October 2012: Sara, editor of Global Voices in Portuguese, publishes the story in Portuguese with the collaboration of Diego, Elisa, João Miguel, Luís and Raphael.
October 25, 2012: Janet begins translating the article into English, with the support of our Multilingual Publisher Paula in London and João Miguel in Fortaleza for the subtitling of the inserted video.
The English version is sent to the sub-editors' mailing list, where it is picked up by Kevin in Melbourne, Australia.
Kevin corrects the post, and it is posted on the Global Voices English site.
In just a few hours, nine people from three continents, five countries and seven cities have collaborated to spread the story of the "Guarani Kaiowa's Cry of Resistance" to the world in Portuguese and English.
October 26, 2012: Ines translates the post into French.
31 October 2012: Cristina, Mario and Gabriela translate the post into Catalan, German and Spanish, respectively.
2 November 2012: Giulia translates it into Italian.
Right now, other Global Voices teams are doing exactly the same, across borders and time zones and languages, to expand important citizen-driven stories that mainstream media don't have the time or interest to cover.
We are grateful for the funding we receive from the foundations that have supported us over the past few years, but to continue doing what we do, and to remain independent, free and sustainable, we also depend on the generous support of independent friends and readers like you.
On this New Year's Eve, please consider giving a gift to Global Voices.

Voices of Dignity - Women who survived the armed conflict in Colombia
Voces de Dignidad, a multimedia project of the Center for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), tells the story of Yoladis Zúñiga and Petronila Mendoza, two Colombian women who fled their homes after paramilitaries murdered their husbands and stormed their villages.
The project, launched in late November 2012, includes three photo galleries and a 22-minute video that can be viewed entirely online.
Marta Martínez, producer of Voces de Dignidad, wrote a guest post on Witness joining the 16-day campaign of activism against gender violence, where she explained:
Yoladis Zúñiga and Petronila Mendoza survived a right-wing paramilitary attack on their villages; where they raped women and girls, burned houses and killed villagers, including their husbands.
The two women fled with their children to Baranquilla, a city on the Atlantic coast of Colombia, joining the four million displaced by the civil war.
You are Yoladis Zunigga.

Marta also highlighted the message that she intends to give Voices of Dignity:
As the Colombian government begins new rounds of peace negotiations with the leftist guerrillas or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), there has been much speculation about the possibility of a sustainable peace.
The ICTJ's research and comparative experience shows that a sustainable peace cannot be achieved without ensuring justice, accountability and rights for victims.
In the words of María Camila Moreno, head of the ICTJ office in Colombia: The victims are not numbers.
They are people of flesh and blood, with dignity, who have a clear view of the steps Colombia must take to respond to its right to compensation .
I'm going to have to go.
Photo by Camilo Aldana for ICTJ, used with permission.
Through the powerful testimonies of Yoladis and Petronila, Voices of Dignity offers an intimate look at the lives of victims of the armed conflict in Colombia.
An article by ICTJ on Voices of Dignity adds:
By telling the story of Yoladis and Petronila, Voices of Dignity breaks with the stereotype that women victims of conflict are passive actors in a transitional society.
Instead, it shows them as active participants and leaders; of their families and communities, they are not victims, but heroes.
Marta stated that the goal of this multimedia project is to "reaffirm the fundamental rights of victims in Colombia and everywhere: the right to the truth, to be recognized and to be compensated".
Voices of Dignity is available in Spanish, and soon in Arabic as well.
Meeting the Global Voices contributor - Janet Gunter
When a member of the Global Voices community travels to another country, they usually look for ways to meet their GV colleagues in the places they visit.
A few days ago Janet Gunter visited Lima and we met to taste some typical pisco sours, but also to talk about various topics.
Janet Gunter, photo from http://pattamanuch.com used with permission.
How did you get involved in GV?
Through Sarita and our blogs about East Timor.
In fact, we met in person in East Timor.
Then I met Paula in London. She was a great friend.
For me, GV has always been about meeting and working with great people.
So did you start collaborating with GV in Portuguese as a translator, editor or both?
As an author, covering Portuguese-speaking Africa, then when people started writing in Portuguese, I started translating texts into English.
I usually translate articles by African authors.
Tell us about your role in Global Voices' special coverage "Europe in Crisis".
You are a cheerleader!
I lived in Portugal for three years and the events that take place there have personal value.
We have received a very good response from authors and translators, as well as from the public.
In addition, the Greek, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French editions all have very committed editors.
We are currently between sixty and seventy editors and translators collaborating and communicating.
Do you think there is anything that could improve GV's coverage of Europe (in Crisis)?
We need RSS notifications and ideally we would get a publisher, but we're looking for institutional financial support for that.
As a freelancer, working with NGOs while doing work in other areas, how do you reconcile these sometimes so different worlds?
With 30 columns on my Tweetdeck and giving up a "life of my own".
Now seriously, I've realized that my gifts as an activist, especially those related to networking and communication, are very useful in my working life. In the "professional sphere", I get more and more positive responses to my self-description, which is very accurate as to what motivates me and what kind of person I am.
(This came about when I put my interests down on paper.)
Two questions: What motivates you most, and what do you think are the challenges you've faced in the different jobs you've had?
Besides people, what motivates me is a combination of reaction to injustice, creativity, and a desire to see the world.
You say you're a bad tourist, but you've traveled a lot.
Tell us something about this.
I don't have a house or a car.
In fact, I have almost nothing.
I travel a lot for work, but I also enjoy slow train journeys and visiting friends who live far away.
I have too many, I could write a book!
Last winter, I took the train from Los Angeles to New Orleans, leaving my family's house in California, stopping in the plains of West Texas for a couple of days, and ending up visiting some friends in New Orleans.
Then I went to see my 94-year-old grandfather, who was born in New Orleans, and drove two days back to where I was born, St. Louis.
Louis, with my dad, dodging tornado warnings and listening to country music on AM radio.
That's the kind of trip I love.
Apart from all the things she's told us, Janet is taking time to have a personal project, the restart project.
That's what he tells us about:
And well, you can find Janet here and also on Twitter of course.
Saudi Arabia: Hunger strike in support of imprisoned activist
Saudi human rights activist Mohammad al-Bajady has been getting a lot of attention on Twitter over the past few weeks.
Al-Bajady is a co-founder of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and has been detained since March 21, 2011, after taking part in a protest calling for an end to arbitrary detention in front of the Interior Ministry building in Riyadh.
He was tried in secret and sentenced last April to four years in prison.
On 14 November, ACPRA issued the following statement:
In the last call of human rights activist Mohammad al-Bajady, which was on September 19, 2012, he told his wife that he would start a hunger strike after the call to protest the mistreatment.
Our sources tell us he was held in solitary confinement.
Since he announced the hunger strike, he hasn't received any calls.
On December 9, @freealbjadi announced a public hunger strike to support al-Bajady on December 10, International Day of Human Rights:
@freealbjadi: Suffer what al-Bajady faces in prison and announce tomorrow their hunger strike...
Logo of the campaign "Save al-Bajady".
Dozens of reformist figures announced that they would be part of the public hunger strike announced under the hashtag #سأشارك_غدا_بالإضراب_عن_الطعام_تضامنا_مع_إضراب_البجادي, including activist Mohammad al-Qahtani, former political prisoner Matrook al-Faleh and famous blogger Fouad al-Farhan along with 200 others, while the public hunger strike in support of al-Bajady, which took place last March, had only 38 participants.
By strictly banning demonstrations, Saudi Arabia is inviting new methods of public dissent, mostly by young people.
Egypt: Graffiti on the walls of the presidential palace
It seems that the revolutionary spirit has been boosted in Egypt, thanks to the seizure of power by President Mohamed Morsi - his recent resolution giving him broad decision-making power.
The decision sparked nationwide protests and mainly a sit-in was organized around the presidential palace.
Photographer Jonathan Rashad, who has been actively using his camera to document important events since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution, shares the following graffiti photographs that tell the story on his Flickr account.
Here is a selection:

'Sell yourself, you idiot' 'Illegitimate' (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0).
Representation of the military police, accused of committing serious human rights violations against protesters during the transition period in Egypt (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0).
The post office in front of the palace was attacked on December 5, resulting in six dead and numerous wounded.
Subsequently, testimonies of anti-Morsi protesters tortured by Morsi sympathizers began to emerge.
These walls were also the target of graffiti artists.

Another girl raped and murdered in Bangladesh
The victim, Khomaching Marma, was only 14 years old and an eighth-grade student.
Last seen near the jungle while she was driving the family cattle back home.
Rina Dewan posts on her Facebook wall the following comment about the motives behind such atrocity:
There is a settler village called Nallyachari Uttor Matha half a kilometer away from where Thomaching's body was found.
In the early 1980s, the government expelled the indigenous Marmas from their territory and housed the Bengalis there.
Now, these settlers claim a large part of Borodalupara.
Violence against indigenous women has recently increased.

Recently, violence against indigenous women has increased.
A few months ago, another young Indian girl was raped; she was a fifth-grade student.
Journalist Hari kishore Chakma provides some statistics on rape of indigenous women in a recent article in the Prothom Alo newspaper:
Up until last November, 20 indigenous women were murdered in three mountainous districts.
Now, to this list that is only growing, the name of Thomaching Marma is added. According to data from human rights organization Kapaeng, during 2012, 51 women were raped; in 2011 there were 31 victims and, in 2008, four".
This brutal case of rape and murder has once again spread anger across the country and marches have been organized in the Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet regions.
In addition, netizens have also expressed their anger through protests.

Are we as numb as our sister's cold corpse?
India has protested vehemently against the recent gang rape, Imphal demanded justice for the sexual harassment suffered by a girl.
Adivasi Aodhikar Andolon (CHT) writes:
I see on the news how India is screaming at the demonstrations against gang rape on a bus in Delhi. It is fantastic to witness their union. The media also supports them.
The Indian government has been forced to arrest those responsible.
Recently, an indigenous girl was raped and murdered in Borodalupara village, Kawkhali upaliza, Rangamati district.
The police have not arrested a single person responsible!
In this way, hundreds of our indigenous sisters and mothers have long been victims of rape and murder.
Blogger Anik has this to say:
These crimes create an image in my mind of Bangladesh: the image of rapists and murderers.
It seems we're constantly surrounded by heinous rapists and would-be killers.
Don't mess with Egyptian women!
Canadian blogger Maryanne Gabbani wrote a new post titled "Don't mess with Egyptian women" to mention two stories she heard that happened recently in the village where she lives.
He begins his story by stating his observation about women in his village:
The women in my area have my deep and lasting respect.
They care for farms, families and homes in rather harsh conditions, and they never cease to smile, to greet and to reach out to others.
They're the steel of their families.
Although this is a very traditional part of the country and strongly religious, these women are also very tolerant and friendly and have always been a source of laughter and joy to me, an unconventional Candiese growing up.
Then he tells the first story he heard from many of his neighbors, who disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood government, like this:
A neighbor told me how, when the buses came to take the protesters to Heliopolis for the demonstration at the presidential palace that became so bloody a few weeks ago, some of the mothers around me informed their children that if anyone wanted to take the bus into the city, it was fine to do so, but not to bother coming back.
The following story is about a new small religious group of eight people who decided to help the locals behave more "appropriately".
So apparently, a group of Takfir wal Higra (Excommunication and Hegira) moved into our area to help our local population behave more "appropriately".
They were seen walking along the roads in their short galabeyas (traditional clothes) and had taken a mosque to pray and an office in Abu Sir to organize.
About a week ago, eight of the men went to the main souq in Abu Sir and when they entered, they saw a woman sitting near their products, and a little bit of her leg was visible outside the galabeya.
Very rudely, kicking his leg, they told him to cover up and be decent.
This was a monumental mistake.
It turned out that this woman was the head of the souq and a member of a very populous group in the area that numbers in the thousands.
She and the other women in the marketplace attacked the eight men and beat them so hard they had to go to the hospital.
When the men tried to file a police report about the attack, the police refused to take the report and told them that they were not going to go against these women... were they crazy?
So now the young people of Abu Sir are using the office as a tea room and the mosque is no longer used for their fundamentalist sermons and no one has seen the Takfir group for some time.
He concludes his post by confirming:
If anyone asks who to support to get rid of Islamists in Egypt, there is the answer.
The women of Egypt are some of the strongest women I've ever seen.
Bolivia: Potential illegal QR code patent discovered
Bolivian cyber activists have worked collectively to reveal a potential illegal patent on the use of Quick Response Codes, or QR codes, in the country.
In early December, Bolivian netizen @hermany sparked curiosity in the matter by inquiring on Twitter about the allegedly patented use of QR codes in Bolivia:
@hermany: Can anyone tell me if Advice Marketing Ltda. patented QR and they have to be paid for using it? #Boliva #Tech #fraud?
Photo by Lydia Shiningbrightly (CC BY 2.0)
The company's website has removed the patent announcement from its website but activist Daniel Cotillas (@danicotillas) took and shared a screenshot.
Continuing with the collective inquiries under the #QRBolivia tag, blogger Mario Durán de El Alto contacted the National Intellectual Property Service (SENAPI) and representatives of the company.
Mario has been posting updates on the case regularly on his blog under the question "Can the use of QR codes be patented in Bolivia?".
According to the information collected by Mario, Advice Marketing officially declares (pdf) that QR codes can be used publicly simply by prior notification.
Meanwhile, SENAPI executives have confirmed that the company applied for the patent in September 2012; however, SENAPI has not issued a resolution in this regard (the legal period for making a decision is 18 months).
Therefore, such a patent or restriction may not be applicable.
Of course Bolivian cyber activists will be closely monitoring the matter as the case unfolds over the coming months.
You can follow their debate under the hashtag #QRBolivia.
Egyptians demand free and open source software
Much has been said about the liberalising role that technology has played during the Arab Spring, but much remains to be said about the future reciprocal role that the rebellion will have in the liberalisation of technology.
Last Wednesday, the Egyptian prime minister posted on his official Facebook page a summary of one of his meetings.
In this, the government agreed to invest $43.8 million to acquire licenses and software from Microsoft.
Many Egyptian citizens have begun to express their discontent.
@rrcoalition: The government pays $44 million for Microsoft software and at the same time claims it is about to declare bankruptcy.
@Aya_Ayman: Yes, because the government feeds and shelters the poor and homeless in Egypt and they still have a few million left!
However, people are not angry about the huge amount of money that is going to be spent, but they are mainly indignant because there are better alternatives that would cost less and that would help to increase the local software development community.
Samar Ali (@SaMoRaAli) shared this banner on Twitter.
@Gue3bara: Instead of spending all this money, the government could have invested just a million in software developers to create an alternative solution and be able to use open source software.
Omar Ak briefly explains the principles of Open Source Software:
@i3mmoor: Besides being free, the open source software can be modified and there is no charge for updates. #OpenEgypt
Nagla Rizk, founding director of A2K4D (the knowledge access center for development at the American University in Cairo) and a member of the steering committee of the Open A.I.R. (African Open Innovation Research) project, commented on Twitter:
@naglarzk: This contract with Microsoft not only increases its presence in the Egyptian market but also reduces the chances of local small businesses to compete in the market, especially those that rely on open source software.
@naglarzk: The $43 million deal with Microsoft is a considerable setback for #Egypt, especially after a revolution that promised transparency, collaboration and freedom. #OpenEgypt
Hossam El-Hamalawy (@3arabawy) posted a detailed list of reasons why this contract should not be signed.
In addition, many other organizations and users have started signing this petition.
But the matter does not end there: members of the Egyptian open source software community protested in a silent demonstration in front of the cabinet on December 30.
Moreover, more protests are being organized across the country and the #OpenEgypt hashtag is being used to introduce people to open source software and to raise awareness of its benefits.
They kill trees in Egypt
Michael Hanna, an Egyptian blogger and pharmacist, continued his series of lamentations not only over the killing of trees but also the demolition of ancient villas in Cairo's Heliopolis suburb, and wrote an ode to a palm tree.
Three months ago, he took a photograph of what is perhaps the oldest palm tree in the region.
He blogs: Maybe this palm tree was the tallest and oldest in the Heliopolis area, and maybe it's as old as the suburb itself.
An old palm tree on Al Ahram Street, in the Heliopolis suburb.
Hanna continues: The image above was taken approximately three months ago.
Yesterday, I passed by the place, and I was surprised that someone decided to end the palm tree's life... leaving only this.
Trunk debris and just a well where people throw their trash.
A well, where people throw trash, where there was once a palm tree.
Graffiti in Tehran
Iran is not a country known for its freedom of expression or for its public demonstrations, but street art is alive there.
Frescoes, mosaics and other 'permitted' art forms decorate the walls of some cities; and, although underground art is not as visible as in Europe, it is possible to see it in Tehran: graffiti, stickers and templates are present in a more or less discreet way in the cities.
Some walls are completely covered with propaganda paintings (of a martyr, for example), but also abstract or merely ornamental images.
And some of them are real works of art.
A few weeks ago, a photographer from Tehran sent an email with these graffiti images and the following comment:
I took these pictures in Tehran, near a bus stop.
I think someone is fighting with the municipal authorities in Tehran: one day someone does a graffiti and the next they erase it.
And so it goes day after day.
Graffiti in Tehran.
The photo was taken by Melinda Legendre.

Three weeks later, when I asked him for permission to quote him and publish these photos, he said it would be an honor and he wanted to add:
Now they've put something like a drawing or a sign on that wall to prevent anyone from adding any more graffiti.
Before, that same wall was filled with filth; now, at least, it is not disgusting.
So the enemy of the city is now a friend of the people because the wall is no longer dirty.
Those who express themselves in Iran are at greater risk than in Europe. At present, there is no law in Iran, but if the authorities consider the work subversive, art can become a crime.
Street art is flourishing in Iran.
Yesterday I deserted Assad's army
As part of our collaboration with Syria Deeply, we are publishing a series of articles that capture the voices of civilians caught in the crossfire, along with perspectives of the conflict from writers around the world.
Next, a conversation between News Deeply and a 20-year-old man who defected from the Syrian Army's Sulas Military Base and joined the rebel side.
At your request, we will not use your name in this article.
We are in a house used by the Free Syrian Army deep in the mountains of Jebel Turkman, in Latakia province.
As the bombs waved through the windows, he shed light on the complicated mentality shared by many of Bashar al-Assad's soldiers: men forced to fulfill mandatory seasons in the army, desperate to join the opposition.
"It's the first time I've seen a journalist or an American", he says timidly.
It says a Shabiha escort was assigned to each new soldier, to make sure he didn't desert.
This came after a recent spate of defections that apparently shook the confidence of the army.
"The soldiers were scared of the Free Syrian Army.
Many of them would like to desert, but the Shabiha, they stay with us, they watch us as security so we don't leave".
The destruction of Douma, Damascus.

The young soldiers hardly talked about the matter among themselves.
I was just talking about this with my family.
I couldn't talk to anyone else about it, even though we all wanted to leave.
I would never do that... shoot in the air, give everything but the fighters.
A lot of people do that. The people who watch don't notice.
The officers have power and they say 'we will succeed, we will go home'.
But the fighters know it's coming.
He served most of his time in the army in Idlib, and was stationed in the mountains of Latakia for the last two months.
At that point, he says, "I've never had a vacation.
Before coming to our interview, I was concerned for my safety to speak to him. How could the leader of the Free Syrian Army battalion who introduced us guarantee that his new fighter was not really a double agent who would inform on us to the regime?
"I spoke to your father in Damascus", the leader told me.
Trying to give me confidence, he said that given the security of the regime's base, and based on the physical terrain, only the most loyal men manage to escape.
Tradition of the Three Wise Men in New York
This Christmas celebration, with a complex historical and religious background (like Christianity itself), has been part of Caribbean and Latin American cultural traditions for several centuries.
In Puerto Rico, for example, on the eve of kings, children leave grass in a shoebox for Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltasar's horses to thank them for the gifts they will receive the next day.
Below we share a series of photographs taken by Puerto Rican artist Josué Guarionex, showing some of the faces he managed to capture in the midst of that entire movement.
Jesus "Papoleto" Melendez, a poet born and raised in El Barrio, was elected as king emeritus of the parade.

Osvaldo Gomez delighted us with his beautiful presence.
You can almost feel the energy of this band in this photo.
Hundreds of girls and boys marched with their paper crowns from 106th Street to 116th Street and Park Avenue.
The outstanding reporter María Hinojosa, as well as activist Angie Rivera, were chosen as the queen magicians for this occasion.
Fatima Shama, commissioner of the New York City Office of Immigrant Affairs, was chosen as one of the queen magicians.
Tanya Torres, a Puerto Rican artist based in El Barrio, was one of the godmothers of the parade alongside Nadema Agard, Cecilia Gastón, Christine Licata and Sandra Morales-De León.
Walking the streets of New York with so many kids is a tremendous gift.
Cuba launches long-awaited immigration reform
On 14 January 2013, a historic immigration reform came into force in Cuba, which should make it easier to enter and leave the country.
According to the Havana Times digital newspaper, Cubans can now apply for a passport to travel outside the country for up to 24 months, without having to apply for a special government permit.
The new regulation removes the previously required "exit permit" and "invitation letter" and relaxes the rules for healthcare and sports professionals and those who migrated illegally.
In August 2012, the author of "The Other Eyes of Eva" alluded to "internationalist missions", governmental projects to help other countries mainly in sectors such as education and health that also represent an economic relief for Cuban professionals.
In another (fictional) article, the author recounts a father's departure from Mariel port:
My father jumped into the sea, pushed himself over the waves and disappeared into the horizon, leaving us an empty seat at the table and the hope of filling the pots again very soon.
From January 14, 2013, Cuban citizens will be able to apply for passports at the Identity Card and Population Registration offices as well as Immigration and Expatriation to travel outside the country without having to ask permission from the government.
Immigration and Refugee Offices on the first day of the immigration reform.

According to a Havana Times report, which cites the Immigration and Expatriation Directorate, a total of 195 sites have been enabled for this purpose.
According to this digital magazine, "it is estimated that the historic reform will benefit a large number of Cubans who, provided they can finance the trip and obtain the visa of the destination country, will be able to travel abroad with greater ease".
However, "it will not involve mass exodus from the island.
Regarding travel to the United States, an article published by the online site Café Fuerte notes:
Cuba will allow its citizens to travel as emigrants and even take advantage of the Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) in the United States without losing their rights as residents of the island within two years, a senior government official announced.
But some citizens, including high-performance athletes, will still have to apply for permission to leave the country.
In addition, the law includes a clause that has been questioned by several bloggers.
Fernando Ravsberg, author of Letters from Cuba, points out:
However, the "H" section states that they cannot travel "when for other reasons of public interest, the competent authorities determine so".
Such vagueness gives officials absolute power over the citizen.
The shortage of teachers could be considered a reason of public interest and the Ministry of Education may feel empowered to prevent a teacher from travelling.
Dozens of foreign media outlets have echoed the news and some users from other nations celebrate Cuba's immigration reform, though they note:
Cuban state television broadcast a television program with more details on the immigration reform.
Indonesia floods: Jakarta placed in state of emergency

Patagonia Argentina, a popular place for travel bloggers and tourists
For this summer vacation 2013, Argentines have chosen Patagonia Argentina as their destination.
According to the newspaper Perfil, in its Tourism sector, one reason has been the prices and wide variety of tourist attractions.
But also, Patagonia is a destination for those who want to cycle around it, as is the case of the bloggers of La Vida de Viaje, who are recounting their entire journey, adventures and misadventures through their blog:
After cycling for a few hours to Tolhuin, we stopped for two days at the Ullua family's house who contacted us via Facebook to get to know us and to have a place to stop when we arrived.
We found that this town places a special value on cycling.
Other Argentine bloggers, decide to travel by hand, as is the case of Juan and Laura de Acróbatas del Camino who have not only travelled around Patagonia, but are currently also traveling the world.
In one of their posts, they recount their experiences in Puerto Madryn and their concern for the environment.In the Valdéz Peninsula every year, southern right whales are spotted arriving every year to the Argentine Patagonian coast to breed:
Even before I saw the first whale, I couldn't get two thoughts out of my mind.
The human being walks around like a voyeur celebrating species whose cornering he subscribes to with the rest of his social habits.
There are uncomfortable truths, but charging the car's tank is fueling global warming that lowers the concentration of krill that the whales feed on.
And the post goes on
Of course, all tourists arrive by car, and many would be willing to have one for each family member if possible.
Because of course, you have to take the kids to school.
To teach them to take care of the environment for example... Even we fall partly into this contradiction, by traveling by hand and using cars, although I console myself by thinking that we only occupy an empty seat in a car that is already moving.
Photo taken by the author of the post.
We always like to have a lot of kids in the shows, but in the case of hospitals it's very different: the fewer the better.
Children should not be there, they should be playing in a square, that's why we always say goodbye to hospitals with the same phrase: we wish them with all our heart to leave here as soon as possible  and every time we say that parents close their eyes and nod.
I hope so.
Creating spoken dictionaries for indigenous languages
As part of the "Enduring Voices" workshop, between January 7 and 11, 2013, twelve Latin American indigenous language activists gathered at the Santiago Library in Chile to explore how digital technologies can play a key role in documenting and revitalizing their native languages.
Organized and sponsored by the Enduring Voices Project, a collaboration between the Living Tongues Institute and the National Geographic Society, the workshop provided practical training on the use of digital tools in the workplace.
Rising Voices also participated and gave a workshop on using citizen media to promote the use of indigenous languages online.
The main activity of the workshop was the creation of Talking Dictionaries.
This platform provides a multilingual online dictionary containing digital audio clips recorded by language activists currently working with the Living Tongues Institute.
Each participant received a Technology Kit based on their current needs.
Some of the activists received laptops, digital audio recorders and digital video cameras, tripods, headphones with the ability to cancel or decrease ambient sound and external hard drives to use in their work.
Participants examining the received technology kit.
However, the digital audio recorder was the one that played the most important role in the creation of the Spoken Dictionary.
Each participant was able to record audio clips of excellent quality which were later edited in free programs such as Audacity.
The clips are tagged and uploaded to the server, hosted by Swarthmore University, where they are placed in the database in parallel and display the word in the indigenous language, English and Spanish.
Here we see Espiritu Bautista and his son Elmo recording audio clips of words in Yanesha, their native language, which is spoken in the central part of the Amazon region in Peru.
At the end of the workshop, nine new spoken dictionaries of languages such as Mapudungun, Tsesungun, Quechua Chanca, Yanesha, Miahuatec Zapoteco, Mazahua, Mam, Pipil, Besiro and the extension of an existing dictionary in Ishír (Chamacoco) were presented.
Each participant returned to their local community equipped with the tools and knowledge to continue adding more words to spoken dictionaries with a clear mandate to explore the best path for their use in communities.
Colombia: A long road to peace?
This post is part of our special coverage International Relations and Security.

In the early hours of New Year's Day, the Colombian Armed Forces launched an airstrike on a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) camp near Chigorodó in northwestern Colombia.
The airstrike came after Elda Ramirez (aka 'Mayerly'), considered a high-ranking member of the FARC hierarchy, called a man she believed to be a drug dealer interested in buying cocaine.
To support the peace negotiations, the FARC announced a ceasefire on November 20.
However, the Colombian Armed Forces have continued military operations against the organisation.
On 20 January, the FARC announced that they had suspended the ceasefire and instead proposed a bilateral truce.
The Colombian government attack and the broken ceasefire provoked a variety of responses from Colombian bloggers.
For example, a blogger in Colombia Opina celebrated the bombings and explains why the FARC's Fifth Front was so dangerous (links inserted by GV):
FARC's 5th Front was a kind of terrorist training school.
From Efraín Guzmán to Iván Márquez, and from the today demobilized Karina  to the still raised in weapons alias  Manteco , they have passed through the 5th front of the FARC, an old and bellicose guerrilla structure that the morning of December 31 received another blow from the Colombian Air Force in the Operation Fortuna : a bombing that left at least 14 bandits dead and restores the hope of security necessary to the inhabitants of a strategic area such as the Bananero Axis, which also borders the corridor that goes from the Serranía de Abibe and crosses following the route of the Río Sucio to the Atrato Medio.
In contrast, Camilo Raigozo criticizes President Santos' "happiness" with the killing of the guerrillas:
The regime headed by President Santos has refused to stop the orgy of blood and death that is mourning the Colombian people, by not accepting a bilateral truce of fire, even for Christmas and New Year.
The insatiable bloodlust of those in power prevents it.
Horacio Duque, in Tercera Información, wonders if the unilateral ceasefire of the FARC has worked (link inserted by GV):
It seems from the data provided by experts who follow the fighting closely, that in the first 30 days the success has been resounding.
Fernando Dorado writes about the convenience of extending the ceasefire:
If the ceasefire period were to be maintained or extended  beyond the Christmas and holiday season  the FARC guerrilla would be putting all the pressure on the government to agree a bilateral ceasefire, which would give more impetus to the Peace process.
It seems that the Colombian government's reluctance to respect the FARC ceasefire is intended to weaken the group both militarily and strategically.
The effectiveness of this strategy will likely be determined throughout 2013, especially as the deadline (in November) for a peace agreement approaches.

Colombia: Bullets continue to sound in Medellín
The city of Medellín is in a difficult public order situation.
The most named area is Commune 13, where there were several clashes overnight last weekend.
The situation was of such magnitude that the Metrocable transportation system had to suspend operations for fifteen minutes, and there were two injuries from stray bullets that impacted one of its cabins.

Regarding the events, two Twitter users, Juan Mosquera (@lluevelove) and rapper Jeihhco (@Jeihhco) expressed themselves as follows, expressing their grief and calling for reflection.
Global Voices brings together their voices by listing some of their tweets on the subject:
I 'm not going to lie .
@lluevelove: Bullets at night, silence at dawn, gunpowder at noon, fear at afternoon.
@lluevelove: The whole city as one.
The whole town's a commune.
You and I have intact skin but we're both injured, like the one you don't know.
I 'm not going to .
@Jehhico: Bullets are heard, again and unknown until Commune 13 burns, Medellín burns.
@Jehhico: In the midst of the gunpowder, the bullets are camouflaged, in the midst of life, death is getting closer, sounds that hurt in the heart, in the soul.
@Jehhico: It hurts so much shit in the streets, the silence in the neighborhood at this hour is a painful silence, it's terrifying, it's pure fear, latent.
In parallel to the above events, a hashtag called #Medellínnotienealcalde emerged, through which netizens proposed a conversation around the problems of the city, which has been characterized by its strength, but also by a history of violence, and which is now nominated for an award as the most innovative city in the world:

Mexico: Explosion at Pemex headquarters causes shock and speculation
At least 14 people have been killed and 80 injured so far as a result of a powerful explosion that on Thursday, January 31, 2013 shook the headquarters of the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) in Mexico City as reported by the company's official Twitter account:
@pemex: Sadly 14 dead and 80 injured confirmed so far
Some netizens, besides lamenting the events, speculated about the real cause of the explosion.
As Think Mexican (@ThinkMexican), who noted through his Twitter account:
@ThinkMexican: The explosion at the #Pemex Tower comes days after @EPN responded to speculation that its admin was looking to privatize Mexico's oil.http://ow.ly/1RJUGC
Or the journalist and writer Raúl Tortolero (@raultortolero1), who asks:
@raultortolero1: Will we know with transparency what happened in #Pemex today, or just versions by mode?
While others like Ana (@AnaLargaespada) spoke about possible negligence:
@AnaLargaespada: #Pemex facilities had already had 2 explosionshttp://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/899965.html ... (see video).
That smells like bad driving.
And some others think it was the cartels' fault, as Jorge (@TwytterMx) expresses:
@alexoescalona: I think it's fine not to speculate that Pemex was an attack, but we also shouldn't assume it was an accident. #PEMEX
On the other hand, there were some outlandish comments that many reacted to, such as filmmaker and columnist Mariano Bouchot (@marianobouchot), who disapproved of the jokes about the topic:
@marianobouchot: I don't understand or justify the jokes that are made around the tragedy.
What happened today in #Pemex is no joke.
There were also many netizens spreading useful information.
For example, Fherb (@LFernando24) tweeted:
@LFernandoo24: Help please: Blood donors needed at Pemex Central North Azcapotzalco hospital... #Pemex
And Maru Iniestra (@889Maru) shares a link with report of wounded:
While a large number of netizens are already offering condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, such as economist and blogger Guillermo Barba (@memobarba):
Pemex's website already shows a black ribbon as a sign of mourning.

Egypt silent on Sinai floods
The Sinai is being ravaged by flooding after heavy rains in the region.
There is very little information available in online media, amidst a total silence in traditional media.
On Twitter, Ibrahim Elgarhi addressed a tweet to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, saying:
@Ibrahim_Elgarhi: Urgent and humanitarian: There are numerous families under siege in Sinai, in Firan Valley, who have been isolated by the floods and need urgent help.
Please note that Sinai is part of Egypt, dear President.
Faced with the lack of help from the authorities, Alyaa Gad is gathering support for the action among netizens:
@AlyaaGad: How do we help the 1,400 families surrounded by floods in Sinai? (Forget the government because there is no government).
What can we do?
@waelabbas: There are 1,400 families isolated in South Sinai in Firan Valley due to flooding.
They're without food and electricity and no media or politicians or anyone is talking about them.

The dispute over the maritime border between Bolivia, Chile and Peru
This post is part of our special coverage International Relations and Security.
Map of the maritime claims of Ecuador, Peru, and neighboring countries.
From Political Geography Now by Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)
International borders are often erased by globalization processes, but in South America some maritime borders remain contested.
For example, Chile and Peru, neighbors who have enjoyed sustained economic development in recent years, remain at odds over some 38,000 square kilometers of sea along their maritime border.
Bilateral negotiations between the two countries were first held in 1980, but no agreement was reached.
In 2008, Peru took the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which in turn considered the issue in a public hearing in December 2012.
Meanwhile, Peru continues to argue that the maritime boundary has not yet been defined by any agreement, with documents signed in the 1950s only concerning access to fishing zones.
Lima also states that maritime boundaries should run diagonally southwest from the land border.
Chile, for its part, maintains that the maritime boundaries were agreed upon after the signing of the 1952 and 1954 treaties.
They infer that the maritime border should run parallel to the equator line, an agreement that Santiago claims Peru has respected for the past 60 years.
Supporting the Chilean position, the cyberaute Juan Vargas commented in Peru this Week:
The agreements of 1952 and 1954 clearly indicate and establish a maritime boundary.
They can be found in English at: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/58820.pdf
Oscar Maúrtua de Romaña, a former Peruvian Foreign Minister, describes the arguments of both sides in a post on the El Mirador blog and concludes:
Peru and Chile, despite their historical differences, share a common destiny.
A fair ruling by the court will put an end to the one border issue that casts a shadow over our bilateral relations.
It is reassuring that President Humala and President Piñera, 72 hours before the oral phase began, made a joint statement in which they both committed to abide by and implement the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
Bolivian coast awaits decision
The dispute between Chile and Peru also has direct implications for other states in the region.
In particular, Bolivia is closely following the legal procedures, and has previously stated that it plans to make a case in the International Court of Justice for Chile to facilitate access to the Pacific coast that it lost during the 1879-1881 war between the two countries.
The final outcome in the ICJ case may add a new impetus to Bolivia's attempts to seek a diplomatic solution to this long-standing problem.
Regardless of the ICJ ruling, democratic and diplomatic declarations made by all parties have significantly reduced the risk of armed conflict between the parties.
This, in turn, has laid the groundwork for the development of more creative solutions to end the crisis.
These include a "bilateral maritime zone of participation" proposed by Jilmar Moisés Córdova, who argues:
The maritime dispute between Peru and Chile can be resolved by establishing a Maritime Bilateral Participation Zone which would divide the seas of both States and be used for fishing, i.e. the exploitation of living resources by vessels of up to a certain tonnage of the peoples of Peru and Chile.
For example, Argentina and Uruguay maintain a treaty similar to this one that delimits their sovereign seas.
Córdova also believes that this alternative could give both countries the opportunity to explore and benefit from minerals, oil and other resources.
It also hopes that the Maritime Zone of bilateral participation could offer alternative options for the aspirations of a coastline for Bolivia.

Search for missing child unites Malaysia
William Yau is a six-year-old Malaysian boy who stayed in the car with his brothers while his parents went to a home appliance store on January 16.
His sister Cindy reportedly started crying, which caused him to get out of the car to go find his parents.
He never came back.
On Thursday, January 24, the boy's body was found in a river.
According to the DNA results released on Monday, January 28, police have confirmed that it is indeed William's body.
The search for William was prompted by the media using the National Urgent Response Alert (known as NUR for its English name) and quickly spread on the internet.
Malaysians posted posters and pictures on their blogs to help locate him.
From ordinary people like Eliza Teh to expert journalists like Nuraina Samad and Ahirudin Attan used their blogs to draw attention to William's case.
He's still lost.
Have you seen William?
If you have any information, please call 03-56319800 and 012-2197133.
Posters of William Yau were posted on various social media sites.
So far there's been an outpouring of grief for William's family on social media.
Joel related how he too was separated from his parents when he was a child.
I still remember the incident well: a five-year-old boy in his pajamas, wandering around the old City Mall in Kuala Lumpur.
My parents were shopping at the subway, and I was restless.
I walked to the nearest Toys R' Us without my parents knowing, and before long, I got lost.
The fact that I'm writing about it is proof enough that nothing unpleasant happened to me.
The same cannot be said of little William Yau.
The case of William Yau, which has dominated headlines and various social media sites, has had the worst possible outcome.
The badly decomposed body of little William was found floating in a river in Klang, a week after news of his disappearance launched a massive search.
I had a deep sense of grief that overwhelmed me, I felt the pain of little William's family, the pain of losing someone dear to me.
Netizens helped spread the word about the search for the missing child.
Tumblr photo from Made by Malaysians.
Norliza Sani expressed her solidarity with William's parents:
A father's worst nightmare is losing a child.
As parents, we often have in mind that we are the ones who should leave first.
I think we all know that death comes to everyone, regardless of age, but no one is prepared when the situation finally occurs.
My heart goes out to William Yau's parents.
May your son rest in peace.
I also have a six year old son, I hope that whoever did this to his son will be caught and severely punished, Malaysia has a high number of missing children and no kidnapper is caught.
This is something you should take into account.
It is truly worrying and saddening to think that these criminals can still go free.
Many Malaysians, including celebrities and politicians, took to Twitter to express their grief.

Ecuador: Attack on political rally
On the night of Monday, February 4, 2013, in Quinindé, Esmeraldas province, a man stabbed several people at a rally of President Rafael Correa, killing two citizens and injuring four more.
Through its Twitter account, the Ministry of Interior (@MinInteriorEC) posted the news:
@MinteriorEC: Attention.
A regrettable incident in Quinindé during Rafael Correa's tour.
On the same account, @MinInteriorEC, important facts about the tragedy were posted:
@MinInteriorEC: ATTENTION @PoliciaEcuador has arrested the suspect in stabbing Rafael Correa supporters in Quinindé.

President Rafael Correa (@MashiRafael) reported that he would return to Esmeraldas after the attack:
@MashiRafael: Tragedy in Quinindé!
A deranged man stabs seven AP people while they're waiting for the president.
Two dead.
We're going back to Emeralds!
National media such as El Comercio, El Telégrafo and El Universo, published the news; in La República and La Hora you can find an amateur video of the attack on people who were at the political rally.
RT also echoed the news.
Rafael Correa (@MashiRafael) expressed his solidarity with the families of the deceased:
@Miguicho34: It's a shame to see or read so many people taking advantage of what happened in Quíninde that's not politics, have a little respect for the victims
Arturo Barriga (@arturobarriga) criticizes the political manipulation of the tragedy:
@arturobarriga: I can't believe that there are people so mean that they take advantage of the tragic event in Quinindé to promote one candidate or blame another
Shirley Borja (@ShirleyBorja7) calls for awareness about the violence in the country:
@ShirleyBorja7: Faced with the violence in Quinindé we must not be carried away by those who provoke or incite verbal or physical violence.
Ecuadorians are concerned about civilian safety, and hope justice will be done after this unfortunate event.
Iran sent a monkey into space and another came back
I'll get the monkey ready before it's launched into space.
Photo provided by IRNA
Bloggers and news sources have questioned Iranian government claims that it successfully launched a monkey into space and recovered the animal alive on January 28, 2013.
Official images  purportedly depicting the monkey before and after the launch  do not seem to match, casting further doubt and generating suspicions that the launch could have been a setup.
These are the official images recorded from a program on the state channel IRIB 1:
Many users on the popular Iranian link-sharing website Balatarin say the regime is lying and compare photos of the monkey from before the launch with a photo of the one they claim to have recovered from the capsule on its return, highlighting physical differences between the two.
Here they are:
As you can see in the main photo of this post as well as the one above (right) the first monkey has a mole on his right eyebrow and has gray and shorter hair around his face, while the second monkey has no mole and has hair around his dark brown face.
Netizens' reactions to this report range from total skepticism to conspiracy theories:
Iranian blogger 'Hagh mosalam ma' ('Our Ultimate Right') takes a satirical approach, drawing parallels between the alleged space mission and the 2009 Iranian presidential election that many consider to have been rigged.
He also jokes:
The monkey that was sent into space was a friend, the one that came back was acting strange.
With Photoshop you can send monkeys to Mars, not to mention the outer atmosphere.
Amir Farshad writes on his blog 'Hot Chocolate' that:
Mahmood Ahmadinejad gave the nation another good news this week for the coming of the Fajr festival: "We have launched a monkey into space and managed to perform a cosmetic surgery to remove his mole up there and then brought him back in good health to the arms of the Supreme Leader".
Paraguay: Lino Oviedo's death and its consequences
Lino César Oviedo, retired general and Paraguayan politician who overthrew dictator Alfredo Stroessner in 1989, died on Saturday, February 2, 2013 when the helicopter he was traveling in crashed in the north of Asunción.
The crash also killed its pilot and his escort.
Lino Oviedo and the Paraguayan President Fernando Lugo.
Photo taken in 2012, by Flickr user Fernando Lugo Mendez (CC BY-NC-SA 2.0), who is currently at the top of the list.
The blog La Oveja 100 reported on Monday, February 4:
The helicopter in which Lino César Oviedo was traveling was located today (03.02.2013) in a rural area of Paraguay, north of Asunción, with the bodies of its occupants calcined , reported radio 780 am of Asunción.
A person in the presidential candidate's inner circle confirmed the death , said the broadcaster.
Oviedo headed the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE), and was running for president in the general election to be held on April 21, 2013, in the sixth election held in the country since the coup that ended the dictatorship in February 1989.
In this regard, the blog E'a Periódico de Interpretación y Análisis, makes a brief analysis of the Paraguayan political scene after the death of Oviedo:
Oviedo certainly played an important role in the coup of 2 and 3 February 1989, but a moment of courage does not make a hero, unless instead of courage what was probably there was recklessness or when the moment could have reflected strict disagreements for spurious interests within the dictatorial power.
Heroism implies sustained behaviour that marks positive stories; trying to make a hero of someone who has not had them can only sound like opportunism from those who, like birds of prey, fly over the debris ...
InterParaguay blog, for its part, reports the government's announcement of three days of mourning for Oviedo's death:
Interior Minister Carmelo Caballero, at a press conference in Mburuvicha Roga, announced the government's determination to declare three days of mourning in official activities.
He also said that the investigation will be carried out to determine the cause of the crash of the Robinson 44 helicopter carrying two more people to Oviedo.
Twitter users have also been expressing themselves through the microblogging network.
Fatima Garay (@fatimagaray) talks about the remains of the victims of the accident:
@fatimagaray: Medical team makes the greatest effort to deliver TODAY remains of deceased air tragedy to their relatives including Lino Oviedo
And Anahí Tortorello (@anahitorto) asks him:
@anahitorto: @fatimagaray for today if or if the delivery of loa remains?
The user Klaus Hiebert (@KhaosXI) predicts:
@KhaosXI: Don't be surprised if on one of these new 200,000 or 500,000 bills we find Lino Oviedo's face printed on one of them.
Radio and television presenter Ismael Cala (@CALACNN) expresses his regret:
@CALACNN: My condolences to the family and supporters of #Lino Oviedo, whom I interviewed just six days ago on @CALACNN.
It's going on this Monday.
And then he makes an announcement:
@FernandaAzuaga: The death of Lino Oviedo is not a game!
The Twitter hashtag #LinoOviedo is constantly updated.

In total, four related videos have been posted on YouTube following Mortazavi's arrest.
Who is Mr. Z?
Will his fingers be amputated at Azadi Stadium?
Or will Islam ban punishment for people who steal billions and punish only petty thieves?
Anadrbab has published five photographs of the Larijani brothers and compared them to The Dalton Brothers, the fictional bandits from the Lucky Luke comics.
The blogger asked the same question:
Will Fazel Larijani be punished and have his fingers amputated like the others, or is the punishment only for petty thieves?
Slovakia: Support for 2022 Winter Olympics criticized
While Norway and Switzerland plan to hold a referendum before presenting their proposal for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the fate of the joint proposal by Slovakia and Poland seems to have already been decided: Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico expressed his support without waiting for the government's approval.
Slovakia's expenditure for the Olympics was initially estimated at €200 million, but the finance minister later spoke of €300 million.
Others estimate the figure at around €500 million.
Slovak NGOs, such as the Fair Play Alliance, and opposition parties are calling for an accurate cost analysis and a list of funding sources.
Economist Richard Ďurana believes that "the organization of the Olympics is a very expensive and short-term stimulus to national pride, which only very rich or very irresponsible countries can afford".
Imrich Body, a member of the non-parliamentary party 99 Percent-Civic Voice, sees the Olympics as yet another attempt to "feed the gorilla", referring to the corruption scandal that rocked Slovakia a year ago.
Blogger Matej Bórik has these questions for the Prime Minister:
How do you ensure that there is no overcrowded stage like in London, Athens, Sochi, Vancouver and other megacities?
Do you have enough money in your personal account?
Blogger Samo Marec wrote:
Notice that we've already fought for the Olympics - twice. No one may second my opinion, but I'm convinced that the only purpose is, once again, to privatize public money.
Compared to this plan, he's a poor amateur.
Blogger Karol Šebo, on the other hand, is optimistic:
It is Poland, not Slovakia, that will have the leading role in trying to convince the International Olympic Committee.
Poland, which successfully hosted the Euro 2012; Poland, which has a great influence on numerous organizations around the world.
And not to mention Krakow has a strong international image.
That is why I think that this joint candidacy has a good chance of success, and any good result will give Slovakia the chance to become more visible, something that does not happen often.
For his part, blogger Tomáš Bosák said:
A bid to host the Olympics now, when we're languishing? Why do we need the Olympics? I wonder where the government is going to get the money.
Because I remember the show that got put on and how it got more expensive.
Now, building just one stadium wouldn't be enough.
I don't know, it reminds me of the May Day celebration.
There's no calculations, no paperwork, but let's do it, because people will have fun.
And we'll have a chance to brag.
Mikuláš Huba, environmentalist and re-elected MP, wrote:
Nature is threatened, because the Tatras are not the Alps.
Not give money to doctors and teachers, but give it to officials, politicians, developers and sponsors?
Candidating for the Olympics is a very delicate decision that cannot and should not be made by one person in one day; it requires a serious, prolonged and informed debate not only in parliament but in society as a whole, following the example of Norway.
The Prime Minister has openly shown that he is serious about consolidating public finances and what (and who) his priorities are.
Resources: Open video course for the first time
For those who develop, edit and use video, P2PU (Peer to Peer University) recently created a short course on open video creation.
This course was conceived as part of the Open Video Forum in December 2012 at xm.lab.
The free digital course, which is 15 hours long, teaches you to understand video files, coding, subtitling, video to web, video and HTML, encryption and metadata.
The aim of the project is to eventually create an Open Video Manual, which was inspired by the needs of the Mokolo Lab Project.
Named after the largest open-air market in Yaoundé, it was conceived as a way to integrate existing digital information about the African film industry with the goal of increasing exposure of filmmakers and their works in Africa and the diasporas.
It is currently establishing a digital platform to distribute information and facilitate the network through a single portal.
The developers of P2PU Open Video used a process they called "quick course" to create the online course in a weekend.
This methodology is based on the concept of "fast book", originally developed by Floss Manuals, which places a group of innovators in a salon for a few days to work intensively, culminating in a final product of a book or manual.
Here, this process was used to create a digital course.
During the quick course, Mick Fuzz, who facilitated the activity, wrote a blog post to describe the course process, because he believes that "this methodology can be useful for the emerging group of online educators who create digital educational resources (OERs)".
In the second half, we delve deeper into examples about using open video on the web, moving video metadata and delving into manipulating video command line and frames in Datamoshing, which is a surreal but fun way to learn about how digital video works...
You can find more information about the course creation process on the P2PU blog and about specific activities used during production.
On P2PU, they also encourage reviews and feedback of the open video course.
A PDF version is also available.
P2PU also hosts many other courses in its School of Open, including how to write featured content on Wikipedia, Finding the perfect photo through free digital resources, Using open source software to add audio to video and how to handle copyright on open data.
Free mobile phones for Nigerian farmers?
In late 2012, the Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture made public its plans to provide free mobile phones to rural farmers.
According to this report:
Ibukun Idusote, Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, said the Federal Ministry of Agriculture would procure ten million mobile phones, worth about N60 billion, from China and the US for free distribution to farmers across the country.
Kikiowo Ileowo asks where the government got the statistics - which justify 10 million mobile phones for 10 million farmers - from:
The question is... where are the 10 million farmers exactly?
If your answer is first, what exactly do you produce so that Nigeria has not become a hub for all things food production?
Now, consider that a large part of food production in Nigeria is done through mechanized agriculture that uses less labor.
The "farmers" to whom Mr President wants to provide telephones are subsistence farmers who produce what they consume mainly in their homes.
I have a garden in the back of my house, does that entitle me to be a beneficiary of a 'Jona-phone'?
I see no reason why the president along with his agriculture minister would insult the collective intelligence of Nigerians with a noble gallery-facing idea that has revolutionized countries like Uganda, Kenya and India.
There has since been a correction on the actual cost of phones:
Agriculture Minister Dr Akinwunmi Adesina has corrected the report that the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mrs Ibukun Odusote, said the phones would be purchased by the government at a price of N60 billion, her explanation (was) that the phones will be supplied to farmers through public private partnership...
Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, Minister of Agriculture of Nigeria
Dr. Adesina, Minister of Agriculture, stood up in defense of the project.
In a press release, he said:
When I came in as agriculture minister in July 2011, I found a corrupt and totally inefficient fertilizer sector.
The government was spending huge amounts of money on direct procurement and distribution of subsidized fertilizer, but less than 11% of farmers were getting the fertilizer.
Some of the fertilizer paid for by the government was never delivered to the warehouses.
Some of the fertilizer delivered contained more sand than fertilizer, while a large portion of the government-subsidized fertilizer made its way across borders to neighboring countries, where it is sold at market prices.
This technology-mediated solution, he argues, ended the corruption associated with fertilizer distribution:
We ended four decades of corruption in the fertilizer sector within 90 days of my taking office as minister.
How did we do it?
We were able to provide subsidized fertilisers and high quality seeds to our rural farmers by introducing the GES (Growth Enhancement Support) system in April 2012.
The GES system provides inputs (fertilizer and seeds) to farmers directly through the use of farmers' mobile phones.
We created an electronic platform (e-wallet) where we register farmers and agricultural traders who own stores that sell agricultural supplies across the country.
To date, 4.2 million farmers and nearly 900 agricultural distributors have been registered.
The minister believes that although many Nigerian farmers are illiterate, they are able to use mobile phones:
Some people think our farmers are uneducated and can't use cell phones.
The evidence does not support that claim.
Under the GES system, we have made it possible for farmers to conduct business in their own local languages using their mobile phones.
Data collected based on farmers' use of mobile phones to access fertilisers and seeds last year shows that the total number of telephone transactions with respect to the GES system was 4.9 million.
Of these, 1.2 million were in English, 620,000 in Pidgin, 2.2 million in Hausa, 854,000 in Yoruba and 344 in Igbo.
From this data, we have no doubt that our farmers are perfectly capable of using mobile phones.
Technology, according to Dr. Adesina, helped him in his conclusion that there would be no food crisis after the floods that swept through parts of the country:
When the floods came, there was panic in the country... I didn't worry.
We use modern technology to guide our decision.
Using remote sensors and satellite imagery, the extent of the flood was mapped and determined that no more than 1.17% of our cropland was affected by the floods.
Our detractors wanted the world to believe otherwise, that a food crisis was imminent.
They were wrong.
Today, five months after the floods, we don't have a food crisis.
However, some netizens still have unanswered questions.
Olusola Adegbeti asks the question:
So one must ask pertinently, if only rhetorically, whether the purchase and distribution of GSM phones to hundreds of farmers spread across a country as large as Nigeria is the most critical and difficult of the problems plaguing the Nigerian agricultural sector at the moment.
As a result of the foregoing, it is appropriate to say that it does not take the wisdom of Solomon or the prophetic vision of Isaiah to be guided in the direction of the multitude of problems that have since made the agricultural sector miserable, issues such as lack of access to farmland, the absence of reliable and corruption-free financial institutions to empower farmers to acquire the machinery needed for the modern, commercial mechanized agriculture that is often the backbone of every nation, the lack of easy access to the technology and agrochemical support structure needed for sustainable annual and perennial cultivation, as well as animal husbandry....
The Sun asks if farmers really need new mobile phones, when they already have one or have other sources of information:
The telephone is clearly not the best way to reach farmers, who mostly live in rural areas.
Rural information centres, traditional communication models and radio are much better channels.
There are also many more direct initiatives than the provision of telephones through which the government can boost agricultural production in the country.
More importantly, the government doesn't have to buy phones for farmers because those among them who could use those phones already have them.
With phones on sale in the country at prices as low as N2000 to N3000, any farmer who deserves that name can afford to own one, and most likely already has one.
If not, what the government has to do is give them the possibility to be able to afford such a basic tool.
Disu Kimor thinks it's another useless project:
These useless projects will only reinforce the perception of Nigeria as the laughingstock of the rest of the world where we like to teach sign language to the blind.
Any developing country like Nigeria, wishing to develop its agricultural sector will focus direct government intervention to help farmers and boost food production on achieving a stable supply of working capital, improving research and development, water supply, ensuring low fuel and labor costs, subsidizing (without corruption) agricultural machinery and basic infrastructure.
Disu concludes:
One day, posterity will judge the quasi-autonomous government agencies and political leaders of this country, whose main concern is to keep the country on its knees or to malvert and waste much needed public funds.
Dancing to the rhythm of history with marrabenta in Mozambique
This post was originally published on Afribuku, a blog about contemporary African culture.
It is often said that Mozambicans start the year "marrabantando".
That is because every year, at the beginning of February, the most representative festival of the country, the Marrabenta Festival, is held.
Everywhere you go, you hear "teka, teka!" , the expression used while dancing, which is a fast, contagious rhythm and makes it difficult not to get carried away.
But in Mozambique, talking about marvelous music is also something serious, because in every hypnotic rhythm, the colonial past and the country's identity resound.
The Marrabenta Music Festival This time, from 1 to 3 February 2013, the famous Congolese composer and singer Sam Mangwana and other Mozambican musicians such as Dilon Djindji, Radio Marrabenta, Xidimingwana, Orquesta Djambo or Cheny Wa Gune, performed at the sixth edition of this festival held in the city of Maputo and in the villages of Marracuene and Matalene.
As every year, a train with live music left Maputo and took musicians and audiences free to the village of Marracuene.
An hour and a half of travel on the "Marrabenta Train", people also joined the celebration of Gwaza Muthini, which coincides with the date.
The train of madness.

Resistance music
The Gwaza Muthini ceremony commemorates the famous Battle of Marracuene, which took place on 2 February 1895. In this battle, the warriors of the Gaza Empire, under the command of Ngumgunhane, resisted the Portuguese colonial army.
Ngumgunhane's men lost the battle and this was the beginning of the end of the Gaza Empire.
In the past, a hippopotamus was hunted and its meat was distributed among the population to commemorate the date.
Today, hippo meat has been replaced by goat meat, which is often enjoyed with a local spirit called "canhu" - consumed while dancing to the sound of the marrabenta.
The history and evolution of the marrabenta was not easy.
It emerged in southern Mozambique in the late 1930s, but it was not until the 1960s that it became more popular.
Multicultural and multiracial policies within the Portuguese colonies in Africa facilitated their expansion into Mozambique and its cities.
The arrival of the first gramophones from South Africa and the emergence of local music broadcasts also contributed to its spread.
The legendary Dilon Djindji during his performance at the 1st Marrabenta Festival.

Fighting music
The Portuguese regime in Mozambique required that only Portuguese music be sung and danced during most of the colonial period.
To defend their cultural identity, several organizations emerged, such as the African Association (AA) and the associative Centre of Negroes of the Province of Mozambique (CANPM), which ended up playing a fundamental role in promoting Mozambican culture.
In this way, marrabenta became a struggle music whose themes are inspired by the experiences of daily life, love, social criticism and important events that occurred in Mozambique.
He's a freak at the African Association.
Photo from the personal file of Elarne and Fredo Cariano.
The evolution of the marrabenta
The rhythm was first played with homemade four-string guitars made with empty reeds and wooden pieces.
The mix of magikay and zukuta rhythms from the south of the country and the assimilation of Western rhythms such as black American and South African music that reached the former Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), enriched this new genre.
She had no name until 1930, but eventually adopted the name marrabenta.
Sam Mangwana from the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire, when he was born) arrived at the festival for the first time this year.
Marrabenta Festival 2013. A poster published in afribuku.
Five years have passed since the first edition of the Marrabenta Festival, thanks to the initiative of Litho Sithoe.
And five years later, the festival continues through the determination and perseverance of its organizer.
On February 3, the festival ended with a concert at the Cultural Center of the city of Matalane.
This day is celebrated as "Mozambique Heroes Day", a national holiday commemorating the lives of fallen soldiers who fought bravely for the country's independence in 1975.
The final touch to end a weekend breathing, living and feeling amazing.
No one can predict the future of marrabenta or figure out how the style will evolve in modern times, whether it will take paths towards a more commercial sound.
But what is clear is that in this sixth edition, entertainment was guaranteed.
Bangladesh: All roads lead to Shahbagh
Thousands of protesters continue to occupy the main intersection in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, calling for capital punishment for Abdul Quader Mollah, an Islamist Party leader and others on trial for war crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war.

Many of them are currently politicians from the Jamaat-e-Islami Islamist Party and say they will not back down until they feel justice has been done.
Since it was a Friday and a holiday, a large crowd was expected to join the protests.
At 3pm a mass rally led by youths would take place in Shahbagh.
The Network of Bloggers and Activists, Cultural Activists and Youth Organizations would be heading to the mass rally.
No slogans/speeches would be allowed.

At 3:00 pm, the massive congregation in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, began singing the national anthem.
It's really hard to say how many people gathered to peacefully protest that day.
Many thought that almost 200,000 people joined in solidarity with the protest for stricter punishments for war criminals.
The Network of Online Bloggers and Activists has been leading these protests continuously since Tuesday, February 5.
Many students, teachers, freedom fighters, civil society leaders and families of war martyrs joined the protest.
The protesters are sharing their demands and news of different protest actions through an information website titled Shahbag.org.
On that site, they also report on protests around the world in solidarity with their demands.

13-year-old Saudi girl receives iPad after being infected with HIV
Reham al-Hakami, a 13-year-old girl, was infected with HIV after receiving a blood transfusion at a hospital in Jizan, southern Saudi Arabia.
In the Riyadh office blogger Ahmed Al Omran explains:
The case sparked outrage on social media where many users called for the resignation of Health Minister Abdullah al-Rabeeah.
Al-Sharq newspaper reported that the minister visited Reham at King Faisal Specialized Hospital and Research Center on Saturday and gave him an iPad as a gift, a gesture that drew a lot of mockery on Twitter.
The storm of reactions on the hashtag #الربيعة_يهدي_رهام_ايباد, which translates as "al-Rabeeah gives Reham an iPad", is overcome by this tweet from Summer, which has been retweeted 1,715 times and says:
@Haifa_: What if she dies? Will her family get an iMac?
Olfat Gushgari has a similar idea:
@olfatg: what happens now?
A MacBook for a paralysis caused by a mistake in an amazing surgery
And @7iat_20 wonders why the girl has not been sent for treatment outside the country?:
@7iat_20: The health ministry budget is 86 billion Saudi Riyals and they only give her an iPad instead of sending her to a specialized hospital to be treated?
Bassam Altamimi adds:
@BASSOOME: The future plan of the Ministry of Health is to give an iPad to all medical error victims if they are alive and to their relatives if they are dead.
While Suleiman Alosaimi projects new profits for Apple, the company that produces the iPad, saying:
@bofares_55: North American markets predict a big increase in their profits from selling Apple products due to medical practice errors in Saudi Arabia.

Radio and Internet to help farmers in Africa
On the anniversary of World Radio Day, we published a post about how interactions between the Internet and traditional broadcasting organizations can create more effective radio programs.
With high access and low production costs, says Farm Radio International (FRI), traditional open radio is the technology best suited to the needs of the countryside.
Working to reach farmers in sub-Saharan Africa is like working with a population with a 3% Internet access rate versus 76% access to radio technologies (Farm Radio International website says.)
Although digital resources cannot reach farmers directly, traditional broadcasting can be complemented to make it more effective, and the IRF has launched a series of online resources for use by regional broadcasters across the continent...
Barza is an online community in Africa that includes a peer-managed forum, sample audio clips, and a long list of pre-written radio scripts in several languages (English and French and recently Swahili and Hausa).
Lilian, a broadcaster in Tanzania, uses "Frontline SMS" to send text messages to her audience that are listened to with FRI.
These ready-made scripts vary in their themes from broad (e.g. storytelling and gender equality) to very specific (such as improving food security for Ugandans).

After the protracted war that led to the felling of many fruit trees, Mega FM collaborated with Radio Farm International to promote the cultivation of fruit trees and improve food security - in conjunction with support radio programs about tree care.
This was paired with ICT- mobile phone messages alerting farmers to upcoming broadcasts.
RFI focuses on interactive programming, with quotes and discussions about policies and products among local farmers, not just top-down information.
Akot Janet is a farmer who participated in the program, she was asked if she had benefited from receiving market prices through SMS messages.
She said, "I used to sell my crop at a very low price, just because I had no idea how the market was moving.
I often got confused when I was dealing with the merchants.
I thought I should take the first offer the merchant made.
This information about growing fruit trees has given me much encouragement to start planting trees and improve my income.
I have a good number of mangoes and papaya trees, but I did not know that I could make a living from fruit.
Partners in the field with Farm Radio International
FRI also offers training opportunities, including an 11-week e-course last fall open to Sub-Saharan African broadcasters on designing an effective program to help farmers, as well as weekly trainings on various topics (discussed in the forum) around radio storytelling.
FRI works with Search for Common Ground and Radio for Peacebuilding Africa and prepares a series of ten modules on management and operations in community radio stations to build capacity.

Wikipedia, copyright and freedom of expression on the Internet
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
It is no exaggeration to say that Wikipedia has revolutionized the way we create and access information, showing a sustainable and collaborative model of intellectual work and understanding of phenomena such as intellectual property.
This platform has made it possible for all of us to relate to knowledge in a different way and, in addition, it has put in check closed models of access to knowledge.
In this new #NotemasaInternet testimony on copyright on the web, we talk to Osmar Valdebenito, president of Wikimedia Argentina (and former president of its Chilean version), a foundation that coordinates and makes possible the Wikipedia infrastructure worldwide.
We talked with him not only about how Wikimedia works, but how freedom of expression on the web is fundamental to its development and how initiatives that seek to be even stricter with Internet copyright (SOPA, PIPA, etc.), would make Wikipedia impossible to exist as we know it.
Video: A course on Islam for humanitarian organizations
This post is part of our Global Development special coverage.
A constant debate in the Uncultured Project has been the relationship between the lack of knowledge about what Islam is and how cooperation and development organizations relate to the Muslim community.
Shawn Ahmed has shared a video that explains, in a short and simple way, what Islam is all about in an attempt to pave the way for understanding a large group of people who might receive help.
Shawn Ahmed's April 7, 2012 post, Cooperation, Cynicism and Islam, referenced another post by a Muslim explaining what Islam is about and excluding cynicism as well as respect for others.
I wish more co-operators (especially those who work in countries with a large Muslim population) would understand this and respect it, because there seems to be a tendency towards cynicism, especially in online dialogues, about cooperation and development.
In a November 2012 post, Islam and the discourse of cooperation and development on the Internet, Ahmed reflects on how debates about cooperation on the Internet exclude minorities, even those minorities that are the subject of the same cooperation initiatives in question.
He believes that one reason for this exclusion could be that the tone of these cooperation talks does not reflect cultural norms, and this could be influencing the bad image that the cooperative industry is generating, especially in the case of a Muslim-majority country like Bangladesh:
If the co-workers agree and applaud that tone... then they may be right.
In another post from the Uncultured Project: Islam:101, Ahmed proposes that a greater knowledge of the culture of the communities that cooperative organizations focus on could provide these same organizations with a better environment where, instead of rejecting some work with certain groups out of ignorance and discrimination, they could learn the culture and work from this base.

Don't get me wrong, "It's Colombia, not Columbia".
In an attempt to clarify the matter and fix a common typo among English speakers, four young Colombian professionals from digital innovation company Zemoga launched the social media campaign "It's Colombia, NOT Columbia".
As Richard Emblin explains in a post for The City Paper:
We are geographically far from British Columbia and an era of shuttles that survived many missions after the Columbia disintegrated over Texas in 2003.
And yet, many still make mistakes.
There are no Rocky Mountains in Colombia.
We're in the Andes.
But the campaign's mission goes beyond getting people to spell the country's name correctly.
Paul Giles explains in the Colombia Travel blog:
The It's Colombia, not Columbia campaign is gaining momentum in a sustained way in its crusade to show how the country is misspelled only highlights how biased the popular concept of this amazing country is.
Emilio Pombo, one of the campaign's founders, told NBC Latino's Edgar Zúñiga:
We saw this common mistake and realized that it was a platform to start updating the worldview to what is happening in our country.
We're having some great things happen to us right now.
Colombia is becoming a destination and appearing on the world stage.
We want to highlight that and it all starts with people spelling our country's name right.
A social media campaign wants you to say it right: "It's Colombia, not Columbia".
Image shared widely on Twitter and Facebook.
Those sympathetic to the campaign are encouraged to participate by creating an image or video to spread the message.
Afterwards, participants can share their contribution on Twitter or Instagram with the hashtag #itsColombiaNOTColumbia, or upload their work to the campaign's Facebook fan page.
Positive messages about Colombia and images with the message "It's Colombia, not Colombia" have been pouring in to the tag and Facebook page.
"Shakira, the woman who taught you that hips don't lie, she's from Colombia, not Colombia!"
Image shared by the Facebook page of "It's Colombia, NOT Columbia".
"The coffee you drink every morning and gives you 110% energy, is from Colombia, not Colombia!"
@LordLeonMachi: We have a message.
We all have something to say. #itsColombiaNotColombia @OdeColombia #Colombia #Guajira #message pic.twitter.com/U1qCytAq
And @YatsarEl, from the city of Bucaramanga, invites netizens to visit his country:
@YatsarEl: A place where old dreams are coming true, where people work hard and smile a lot.
Much has changed, dare to come! #itsColombiannotColombia
But the campaign has not been free of criticism or jokes.
Nicolás Martínez (@diarionocturno) and others have been playing with the campaign slogan:
@CaroRuizG: What's the point of saying Colombia and not Columbia if everything else would stay the same.
You have to change the background more than the form.
While El gato (@elgatoninja) tweets ironically:
@elgatoninja: The important thing is not that they stop kidnapping, killing or starving.
And Paula Ricciulli (@RicciuP) writes:
@RicciuP: If you call all Asians "Chinese" you have no right to complain because they call Colombia Colombia.
The Facebook page of "It's Colombia, NOT Columbia", launched on February 7, 2013, had over 10,000 users at the time this post was published.

China: Interactive maps of the most and least polluted places
This article, written by Eli Bildner, first appeared in the Tea Leaf Nation on February 20, 2013 and is being republished as part of a content sharing agreement.
Nearly five weeks ago, Beijing experienced the worst air quality day on record: PM2.5 levels  small particles that can cause lung, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases  rose more than 30 times above the level considered safe by the World Health Organization.
Air quality in China  Instant
Since then, there have been reports of the air apocalypse alongside what appears to be a black and white image of the country's iconic cities Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, all of them enveloped in a thick toxic fog.
In fact, China's most popular and prosperous cities are among the epicenters of the latest pollution crisis.
In Tianjin, for example, PM2.5 levels affected 577 people on February 9, Chinese New Year's Eve.
In Beijing, sales of New Year's fireworks fell 37% after the municipal government asked residents to limit their use.
But air quality in China is also a national problem - a difficult situation that affects cities with less recognition than Beijing or Shanghai.
Last week, People's Daily reported that 74 major cities, which are monitored by the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection, reported on February 10, the first day of the Chinese New Year, about "excessive" concentrations of PM2.5.
And as a look at pollution, figures this morning (February 20) show that dangerous air conditions continue across China, from Urumqi (with a PM2.5 concentration of 511 micrograms per cubic meter, or 20 times the recommended limit) to Guangzhou.

Thailand: Surprising election victory for opposition in Bangkok
Sukhumbhand Paribatra of the Democratic Party was re-elected as Bangkok governor despite predictions of his election defeat.
Bangkok Pundit provides a first analysis of the vote:
F. The vote of independents falls to less than 300,000 or 11.28%.
As happens nationally, Thailand is becoming a two-party system.

Using the hashtag #bkkvote, here are some of the reactions from Thai netizens:
@Tinapotjanank if I was out of Bangkok I would have voted for Suharit (No. 17), congratulations to Sukhumbhand, four (boring) more years...
@tulsathit Oh, before I go, the much mocked Sukhumbhand seems to have broken Sundaravej's record as the biggest vote taker.
@veen_NT Historic Bangkok voter turnout: 64% - good job Bangkokers, try harder next time
@Saksith If I'm not mistaken Bangkok and another province are the only ones where the Governor is elected, the others are appointed.
The atmosphere at the Pheu Thai Party headquarters on Petchburi Street became unpleasant for some Pongsapat supporters who punched a television screen, shouted obscenities and pointed fingers at the face of MR Sukhumbhand Partibatra who was giving a victory speech, live, at the Democratic Party offices.
Various electoral bodies must now make a serious examination of conscience and seriously review their polling techniques which, as has been seen, have flaws.
It will take some time before confidence in these well-known polls is restored.
It must be admitted that it is unfair and unprofessional to blame everything on respondents who have been accused of lying to volunteers seeking their opinion.
Bangkokers have spoken out loud... with a turnout of almost 64%, much higher than in the last election, despite the heavy rain that afternoon in certain constituencies.
Ecuador declares three days of national mourning for Chávez's death
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa (@MashiRafael) has declared three days of national mourning following the death of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.
In the press conference he held from the Carondelet Palace, Correa said "those who fight for life cannot declare themselves dead".
The Head of State said that with the passing of Chávez, Latin America has lost a great leader and affirmed that those who fight for their homeland cannot be forgotten.
In tribute to his departure, to his life, Ecuador decrees three days of national mourning.
From where you are, dear Hugo, our commitment to not step back, for this Great Fatherland that our liberators dreamed of, said President Rafael Correa.
Activist Monica Chuji (@Monicachuji), meanwhile, wrote on Twitter:
Why are journalists in Russia quitting?
When the socio-political website OpenSpace was shut down in February, some claimed it was an action against its editor-in-chief Maksim Kovalsky.
This made sense to many, as before running OpenSpace, Kovalsky ran the newspaper Kommersant Vlast '(Power), a position from which he was removed for publishing a photograph of a presidential ballot marked with the words "Putin, go to hell" (the CEO of Kommersant, Demian Kudryavtsev, left the company in protest shortly after this incident).
Now, less than a month later, there are new layoffs.
Two editors-in-chief lost their posts on March 4, 2013: Mikhail Kotov left one of Russia's largest online newspapers, Gazeta.ru, while Alexey Vorobiev is no longer head of Kommersant FM, a Kommersant-affiliated radio station with a strong online presence.
It's hard to overlook the similarities, where the most important is the fact that both editors were fired on the same day by a man named Dmitry Sergeev.
Indeed, there are two high-level media executives named Dmitry Sergeev in Russia, and they chose the same day to make a radical change to their staff, prompting a Twitter user to joke "Russian media have established a special post - dmitry sergeev".
One of these, Dmitry Sergeevs, a senior official at SUP (the parent company of Gazeta.ru and LiveJournal) explained his side of the story in a Facebook post, where he cites a company planning session during which Kotov was sidelined:
This morning, at the planning session, I was appointed executive director of Gazeta.ru with direct supervision of all departments.
Before, all the departments were subordinate to the editor-in-chief and he was responsible for everything that happened in the Gazeta.
Now, according to the new chain of command, the editorial, marketing and commercial departments are directly subordinate to me.
Mikhail Kotov categorically disagreed, saying he could not continue working under these conditions and asked to resign.
Sergeev later explained, and noted that the productivity of the publication was falling behind, and that they published "100 news a day".
He also mentioned that he had no desire to change the editorial direction of the newspaper.
However, according to Anton Nosik (former SUP worker), faced with that ultimatum, Kotov had no choice but to resign.
Although Gazeta.ru is not particularly oppositional in spirit, Kotov's relative independence (he was in charge for over a decade) was apparently seen as a threat by the owners.
Why? Why?
Journalist Vladimir Shusharin thought of an answer:
I have said and written repeatedly that these days quality journalism, especially economic journalism, is sharper, deeper, smarter and ultimately more opposition than the pathetic and mediocre performance of those who have taken on the mantle of democratic opposition.
The other Dmitry Sergeev, president of Kommersant Publishing House, stayed away from social media, explaining to the newspapers that Alexey Vorobiev resigned for "personal reasons".
He also mentioned an important point, that the editorial line of Kommersant FM would not change.
Even if it were true, some see Vorobiev's departure as the final nail in the coffin of the old and rebellious radio station.
After all, he was the deputy editor of the former editor-in-chief, Denis Solopov, who left in the middle of last year amid accusations that Kommersant owner Alisher Usmanov disliked the publication's criticism of the government.
For those still unsure of the overall significance of these resignations, the reaction of Boris Yakemenko, a Putinist of the old guard and brother of NASHI's founder, should be most revealing:
Photographer and blogger Alberto Rojas compares photos of mural art at "The Spanish Route" in Caracas, Venezuela.

The new pope, Jorge Bergoglio, is Argentine
Argentine Jesuit Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the new pope of the Catholic Church.
From today, March 13, 2013, Bergoglio will be known throughout the world as Pope Francis.
Netizens reacted quickly to the announcement that, for the first time in history, an Argentine and Latin American will be the leader of the Catholic Church.
From Buenos Aires, Rodrigo Hernán Torres (@RodrigoH_Torre) wrote:
@RodrigoH_Torre: #Bergoglio is our new Pope congratulations!
And all the success in this new challenge and path that begins, is a historic moment.

@zamosta; Pope Francis is the second most famous Argentine to know the hand of God. http://bit.ly/KpI47u
Even the American TV host Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) commented on Argentine football:
@piersmorgan: Now Argentina has the No. 1 Catholic and the No. 1 footballer in the world. #Bergoglio #Messi
In a more serious tone, Caren Kalafatich (@CarenKalafatich) tweeted:
@CarenKalafatich: We are Argentines, and that is our essence: We celebrate a "Pope" because he is "Argentine" and we don't talk about #Bergoglio as a man and his conservatism
Several users, such as Guillermo Prein, question the new pope's alleged involvement in the Argentine dictatorship of 1976-1983.
Prein wrote (@GuillermoPrein):
@GuillermoPrein: The #Bergoglio notebook elected pope despite his unexplained involvement in the last dictatorship and the siege of pedophiles like Grassi
In subsequent articles we will present more coverage of the reactions of netizens and the analyses made from Argentina and Latin America.
Keep up the information.
Argentines, the government and Pope Francis
While the world waited for the election of a new pope, Argentines were delusional about having an Argentine pope.
The arrival of white smoke in the Vatican announced that the decision had already been made: the first Jesuit pope and the first Argentine pope, Jorge Bergoglio - now Francis - will be the highest authority of the Catholic Church after the resignation of Benedict XVI.
On Twitter, Argentines have spoken through different hashtags, such as #Bergoglio, #HabemusPapam, #PrimerasPalabrasDelPapa, #LaBarraDelPapa, #FranciscoI, among others.
Reactions have been mixed.
For many it was a surprise, as @JessyDelPino writes:
@LuuceroAguirre I really can't believe it, I'm not a believer, or anything, but it's really a PRIDE to finally have a Pope as he should be! #Bergoglio
In the blog De Políticas y Políticos, Rosa Alcántara reproduces an article about the tumultuous relationship between the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and the new pope.
The former bishop and the president have been at odds over a number of issues, including same-sex marriage:
One of the issues on which Cardinal Bergoglio confronted the government was the draft Law on Same-Sex Marriage.
On 9 July 2010, days before its approval, a note by Bergoglio was made public describing as a war of God the gay marriage bill, which envisaged that gay people could marry and adopt children.:
Another confrontation occurred during the commemoration of the May Revolution, an Argentine patriotic date that every year includes the traditional Tedeum in the Cathedral of Buenos Aires.
In 2008, however, the Argentine president decided to change the venue.
The Radio Cristiandad blog comments on this event:
Although the government complied with protocol measures for the change, the decision to take him to Salta, where an interreligious prayer will be held, has generated concern in ecclesiastical sectors.
President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner will also dodge, as her husband did during the presidency, an interpelating homily by the Argentine primate, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, during the Tedeum for 25 May.
Argentines also recall that during the surgical intervention performed on former president Néstor Kirchner in 2010, Kirchner's relatives refused to allow Bergoglio's emissary to give him the sacrament.
Others, like Gladys Lopreto on the blog Equality Dignity, criticize the reactions of the Argentine episcopate on issues such as abortion.
Meanwhile, far from politics, many Argentines celebrate the good news.

Global Voices special podcast: We have a podcast!
Hello everyone, welcome to a special edition of the Global Voices Podcast.
On Tuesday, March 12, 2013, the College of Cardinals met in the Vatican to elect the new head of the Roman Catholic Church, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on February 28.
On Wednesday night, Cardinal Protodiakon went out to the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and uttered the words "Habemus Papam!" ("we have Pope!"), introducing Pope Francis.
With two African cardinals considered at some point to be potential successors to Pope Benedict XVI, we spoke with Steve Sharra and Abdoulaye Bah of our Africa team about the possibility of an African Pope, the continent's expectations for the next Pope, and why cardinals at this week's papal conclave might have played games like volleyball.

St. Lawrence celebrates Pope Francis, his most sacred fan.
Argentine football has not been alien to the joy caused by the appointment of Pope Francis, since His Holiness Francis is a fan and active member of the club San Lorenzo de Almagro, better known in Argentina as the "crows" or the "cyclone".
The club's nickname, "crows", is no accident.
The Goal.com website explains the reason for the name:
The nickname is definitely not random.
Crow, one of the ways of referring to San Lorenzo de Almagro, does not come from the bird but from the popular way of referring to the priests of the Catholic Church, completely covered with black robes.
When news broke that Jorge Mario Bergoglio had been elected as the new pope of the Catholic Church, the official Twitter account of the San Lorenzo club (@SanLorenzo) wrote:
@SanLorenzo: It is a matter of pride for the Institution to know that the first South American Pope is a #SanLorenzo Fellow.
At the same time, the sports institution sent Pope Francis a letter of congratulations.
As if that wasn't enough, in the match on March 16, where San Lorenzo de Almagro and Colón de Santa Fe faced off, San Lorenzo players wore a commemorative jersey to Pope Francis.
Image from the official Twitter account @SanLorenzo
Before the match against Colón de Santa Fe, the account El Papa es Cuervo (@ivannacasla) said:
@Ivannacasla: To see the match at Cris's, let's go San Lorenzo, God and the pope help us!
Anto Gaitan (@Ggaitan_anto), a Boca Juniors fan, wrote in reference to the few tournaments that San Lorenzo have won, and referred to the practice of placing a star for each cup won on the official shield on the shirt:
@Ggaitan_Anto: Lack of stars on the shield. #SanLorenzo came out with the inscription of #PapaFrancisco on the shirt hahaha @ArgEsDeBoca @HinchasXeneizes
San Lorenzo beat Colón de Santa Fe 1-0 and one player down, and club fans, like @Mrrjoness, shared their joy:
@aletati2007: #we go cyclone!! this was our week of SANTA!!!!
Hector Pappa (@hectorPappa) tweeted that the Vatican is having a party, and for Felipe CQ (@FelCul) the only goal of the match was the pope's.
According to Diego Mendoza (@diegol_77), the triumph of San Lorenzo was the first miracle of Pope Francis.
Venezuela: Ortega, the 'destabilizing' tweeter released
Hugo Chavez is cold.
Photo from anticapitalistes.net.
(CC BY-NC-SA 2.5 ES) This is the first time that I have seen this.
UPDATE: Lourdes Alicia Ortega Perez, the Venezuelan who was arrested last week after mocking Hugo Chavez on Twitter, was released from police custody on March 16.
She has since been released, but must appear in court every 30 days.
The Venezuelan authorities are likely to respond to political dissent and criticism with great sensitivity in the days following Chavez's death on 5 March.
Ortega, who tweets with user @ulilou, sent the offensive tweet on March 9 in response to user @douglirodil's one that asked (perhaps in jest) if the president had died.
@douglirodil not sure but turned into wax doll is  Lourdes Ortega P. (@ulilou) March 9, 2013
Last week Global Voices Advocacy covered the news of Ortega's arrest and noted a heavy Twitter activity where many users rejected the notion that a tweet of this nature could be seen as "destabilizing" for the country.
Whether this requirement will be valid for a long time or Ortega will have to appear before the courts indefinitely is not clear.
A legal expert told Global Voices Advocacy that courts have made similar decisions before for cases that involved "rumors" circulating on social media.
Human rights defenders generally agree that the universal human right to freedom of expression is only affirmed when individuals are free to exercise this right "without fear of retaliation".
Although Ortega will technically be able to continue to express her opinions freely online, the court's requirement that her online behavior be closely watched, a move that leaves her at least with some fear of future punishment.
Ortega's Twitter account remains active but she hasn't tweeted since March 12, before her arrest.
A look inside the Indigenous University of Venezuela
How does it feel to be a student at the Indigenous University of Venezuela?
Three students from the Department of Education and Communication recently participated in a workshop run by Rising Voices to learn how to make better digital photographs, upload them and share them online.
Thanks to the university's satellite connection, which was provided by a government program called Infocentros, students can go online to share images of the activities, facilities and impressive nature surrounding the 2,000-acre campus, located in the state of Bolívar.
For more information about the University and the workshop held in February 2013, please read the Rising Voices post.
These are some of the photos taken by the students and uploaded to the university's Flickr account.

Twitter, a tool that turns Mexicans into war correspondents"
Reporting on drug trafficking in Mexico can be deadly.
Journalists and citizens are threatened and even killed for reporting on the violence that has taken over the country.
Despite the danger, many Mexicans are using citizen media to report on shootings, persecutions, killings and arrests, filling a news vacuum that has been left by the country's traditional media.
Sara Plaza Écija in Citizen Journalism summarizes the findings of a new study on the role of citizen media as 'new war correspondents' in Mexico.
Here we share Sara's article which is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0).

An American study, dedicated to the analysis of digital innovation, reveals that Twitter users in Mexico have become the reliable source to report on issues related to drug trafficking in the country, taking over the role of traditional news media.
According to the document Los Nuevos Corresponsales de Guerra: El Auge De Los Medios Ciudadanos En La Guerra Urbana , in cities such as Reynosa, Monterey, Veracruz or Saltillo, Twitter users are the ones in charge of reporting on arrests, shootings and confrontations because of drugs in Mexico, thus assuming informational characteristics of traditional media.
This information has become increasingly influential for Mexicans due to the lack of credibility of the country's major news media.
The research, by Microsoft Research, examines information sharing practices by people living in cities in conflict over the war on drugs in Mexico.
It describes how often citizens use social media to alert others to violence in their communities.
In addition to researching the emergence of citizen media curators , that is, citizens who act as war correspondents  with the dissemination of information.
It is a group of people, whom we call  curators , who have a large number of followers on social networks, which means that they have gained the trust of their community , says Andrés Monroy-Hernández, one of the authors of the research.
The study focused on the four cities most affected by violence, Reynosa, Monterey, Veracruz and Saltillo.
They looked for common traits in the tweets, hashtags and Twitter users who shared the information.
Most of the tweets refer to a place, one of the cities and the word shooting.
The tweets act as a public service advising citizens to stay away from certain neighborhoods.
curators contain a large number of followers and tweets.
It's about people finding information and sharing it.
The study notes that 61% of Mexicans use social networks, but only 20% use Twitter.
About 4.2% of Mexico's online population has posted about the war on drugs or drug trafficking on Twitter , according to Monroy-Hernández.
Violence in Mexico has increased due to this war of drug trafficking and the media has become one of the targets, so some news outlets in the country have become cautious in reporting on these issues.
That's why, that's why the curators  see the need to report.
The researchers tried to interview these new war correspondents, but some of them have remained anonymous for fear of taking the same risks as traditional journalists.
VIDEO: Fire at Ukrainian power plant, uncertain future of a village
At least one person was killed and five injured on 29 March in a major fire at the Vuhlehirska thermal power plant in the village of Svitlodarsk in Ukraine's Donetsk region.
About 12 hours later, the fire continued, the four power generating units of the plant were destroyed and the 12,000 inhabitants were left without heating, hot water and electricity.
Patients admitted to the local hospital were evacuated to the nearby town of Debaltsevo, according to LiveJournal user Pavel Kolesnik, who lives in Donetsk and has been playing videos and photos and sharing updates on the situation on his blog.
Kolesnik/pauluskp posted this video of the first minutes of the fire, recorded by plant workers at a time "when the flames still didn't seem so dangerous":
According to official information, the fire started around 3 pm, however, in a comment to the post by pauluskp, LiveJournal user hannaukr writes that the fire actually started around noon, but the plant workers spent three hours trying to put it out on their own, before finally calling the fire department.
LiveJournal user kotya1975 adds that:
Unfortunately, now the plant is definitely destroyed, and it is important not to allow the fire to spread to the adjacent buildings.
Kolesnik/pauluskp writes that the future of the city of Svitlodarsk, home to the damaged thermal plant, is one of the biggest concerns at the moment:
It doesn't seem likely they'll rebuild the plant. If they don't, it could turn into another ghost town.
Neither the city itself could recover from the (catastrophic accident of 2002) coal mine.

Argentina: Floods in Buenos Aires leave 35 dead
The heavy rains that hit the province of Buenos Aires have left at least 35 dead and thousands damaged.
The blog EA2CPG reports on the weather phenomenon on April 2, which coincided with the holiday for Veterans and Fallen in the Falklands War:
The city of Buenos Aires has about three million inhabitants.
More than 10% of the population has been directly affected by the recent rains, the most damaging in the last 107 years, according to authorities.
The Queen of Silver was in the early hours of Tuesday to Venice and will need many days to resume normalcy.
In the post "#Temporal:Relatos de la Catástrofe", the Amfibia Magazine, among images of the tragedy, also publishes some testimonies of the victims posted on Facebook, such as that of the musician Gabo Ferro:
As this growth met with streams that flow into the Rio de la Plata, they were being piped, their channel filled, and the world was ending.
Urban rent is a temptation that's hard to avoid.
For a time these pipes bore rain well, but as the natural absorbent surface continued to be built, it decreased and the volume of water that began to pass through there increased.
Finally, there are sanitary fillings on the coast of the Río de la Plata to gain surface for real estate purposes that increase the length of the pipes until reaching the natural drainage.

Meanwhile, the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and the government of the city of Buenos Aires are also looking for culprits.
The national news agency Telam publishes the statements of the Federal Minister of Planning, Julio De Vido:
The minister of Federal Planning, Julio De Vido, assured that again the lack of management  of the government of Mauricio Macri leads us to lament fatalities and leaves 450 thousand neighbors without light "in the City.
On the other hand, Comunas 24.com reports that the head of government of the city of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, stated:
Macri recalled that more than four years ago the City requested those guarantees and clarified that the credit, "will be paid by the City in full".

Colombia: No to army raids
"The beatings are illegal" Image posted on the Facebook group "I am Colombian"

Madrid's president defends censorship of images
The president of the Community of Madrid, Ignacio González (Popular Party) has defended in the Radio de Libertad Digital station the establishment of "certain limits" to the publication of compromising images in the media because "we have to take care of the damage to people and institutions".
These statements come days after El País published photos from 20 years ago, in which the president of the Galician Xunta, Alberto Núñez Feijóo (Partido Popular) appeared with the historic smuggler Marcial Dorado, currently in prison.
The Confidencial published statements by the president of the Xunta following the scandal:
I always said that behind those photos there was nothing, and that those photos were just that, just photos, and I also said that I was willing to keep explaining and explaining whatever came up.
This "type of compromising images" was referred to by the president of the Community of Madrid when he aimed to censor the media, in favour of keeping the good image of government institutions.
The reactions on social media have not taken long, becoming a trending topic on Twitter in a matter of minutes:
@ROMARIOIDEG: Ignacio González is forgetting something called: Democracy.
Which involves freedom of the press.
@tOnnijimenez: Ignacio González where will freedom of expression be?
@LaMariMala: Ignacio González says he is not happy about freedom of expression.
@CristianMas86: Ignacio González is more about putting limits on the press that exposes corruption than the corrupt themselves.

New methods of poverty reduction explored
Several Global Voices bloggers took on the task of live blogging the OECD Global Development Forum in Paris on April 4 and 5, 2013.
Ahead of the meeting, our team published several articles on development topics to serve as content for the weekly discussions on their website (#OECDgfd)

As the year 2015 approaches, the deadline for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the search for solutions to poverty reduction opens.
Many organizations explore new answers in the hope that they will bring fresh ideas.
Among the goals agreed by the international community more than a decade ago was to halve the number of people who suffer from hunger and to provide productive jobs for the world's poorest citizens.
Many of the targets are far from being met in most countries, but progress has been made.
For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, where the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 58 percent to 51 percent between 1990 and 2005.
Exchange of ideas on the Internet
As every year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will hold its Global Forum on Development in Paris on 4 and 5 April 2013.
This year, the OECD wants to explore more inclusive methods of addressing the issue of poverty, inviting an open online debate ahead of the forum with OECD researchers.
The main topics of conversation have been made public so that everyone can know about them and contribute.
Concerned African Scholars, an organization of African thinkers and students, hosts another interesting online exchange of ideas.
Among the many issues discussed is the impact of the billions of dollars illicitly leaving Africa due to the slow pace of poverty reduction.
If Africa had not lost so many resources in the form of illicit financial transfers, poverty would likely be far less rampant.
The logic is that keeping these resources in Africa would have produced higher investment rates, allowing African countries to devote money to sectors that promote productivity, such as infrastructure, job creation and income growth, resulting in lower poverty levels.
This strategy of including different stakeholders is also a fundamental principle of the open data movement, which is progressively penetrating the sphere of development.
The Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform, a public initiative rooted in civil society, is an example of what open data can bring to the debate on poverty reduction:
Open development increases transparency and accountability about the resources that can be invested in development, about how those resources are invested and the results they achieve.
In the end, all stakeholders involved in this information exchange  the owners and users of the data  benefit from this mutually reinforcing ecosystem
Air show ends in air tragedy in Dominican Republic
During the second and last day of the Caribbean Air Show, just a few minutes after the show began, a T-35 Pillán aircraft, FAD 1807 registration, of Chilean manufacture and belonging to the Dominican Air Force (FAD), manned by the 1st.
Pilot Lieutenant Rafael Eduardo Sánchez Astacio, and 2nd Pilot Lieutenant Carlos Manuel Guerrero Guerrero, experienced problems during an acrobatic stunt and rushed into the sea.
Less than two hours after the incident, the two lifeless bodies were found and taken to the Naval Base of the Navy in Sans Souci and from there transferred by helicopter to the Doctor Ramón de Lara Military Hospital, FAD.
According to the organizers, the Caribbean Airshow 2013 met all the international standards established by the International Council of Airshows, for shows of this nature, being the same endorsed by these.
The President, Danilo Medina, quickly expressed his condolences:
@RaulRaful: That rescue team was a disaster.
Two tankless divers would find those bodies along with Boca Chica snacks? #ShowAereo
@BartolomePujals: This dramatic event makes several things clear.
1) incompetence of rescue authorities; 2) laziness of organizers. #OJO
Some communicators and social media users claimed that the plane was not suitable for performing aerial acrobatics, to which the communicator and politician, José Laluz, responded:
Chadian blogger arrested
Internet Without Borders reports that Jean Laokolé, a Chadian blogger and writer, was detained on March 22 by security forces in Yamena, the capital of Chad.
In a petition published on Tuesday, April 9, the advocacy group writes: "He was stopped by a group of men dressed in plain clothes while driving with his family".
The petition calls for the "immediate and unconditional release" of the blogger.
Laokolé writes under a pseudonym for one of Chad's most popular blogs.
Since his arrest, Laokolé has remained detained without trial in an undisclosed location, explains Julie Owono of the Africa Office of Internet Without Borders.
Owono writes:
Jean Laokolé contributed last year under a false name to Chad's famous blog http://makaila.over-blog.com/.
In his articles, he denounced corruption, mismanagement and nepotism in this central African country.
He was identified by the intelligence services.
Jean Laokolé (photo courtesy of Internet without Borders)
Laokolé was last seen on March 25 near a military camp, known as "Camp Amsinene".
Local human rights activists told Internet Without Borders that the camp is known to house political prisoners.
In 2012, Amnesty International documented routine human rights violations in Amsinene.
According to Amnesty International, Laokolé comes from a politically active family that has been targeted by the authorities in the past.
His father, Jean-Baptiste Laokolé, is a leader of the political opposition and vice-president of a coalition of opposition political parties.
As for the possible motive behind Laokolé's arrest, Internet without Borders writes:
According to various sources, including family members, police called Jean Laokolé... allegedly about an article published on a blog.
He was suspected of making "false accusations" against a group of people who could press charges against him.
Negotiations were underway for a compromise solution between all parties: it was finally agreed that Jean Laokolé would write an apology on this blog and also send a letter of apology to those who were harmed by the blog.
Talking with Marianna Breytman, translator at Global Voices
During the last Global Voices Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, I met some (relatively) new Global Voices contributors.
One of them was Marianna Breytman, who usually translates from Spanish into English, so she happens to be an avid reader of what we publish from Latin American and Spanish authors on Global Voices in Spanish.
I spoke with her quite informally and in the following short video you can see (and hear) her talking about Global Voices, translations and languages:
After that we kept in touch by email, through which we talked about the following:
Juan Arellano: You just passed the 100 translated posts barrier for GV, was that somehow something you set out to do when you started?
Marianna Breytman: No, I was just saying,
The truth is, when I started Global Voices, I didn't know where it would take me.
I was just doing the translations because it was something I liked to do, it was fun, like I told you in Nairobi.
The 100 posts thing came up when I was approaching my 2nd anniversary with GV (in March 2013) and I wanted to get 100 posts before that.
JA: Any of the translations you've done for GV have impacted you or have anecdotes related to them?
MB: The translations that really impress me are the ones that take place in places I've met. I remember a post Ariel had written about the "red devils" in Panama just when I had made my trip to that country.
I knew I had to translate that post because I had just had this experience of seeing them all over the city.
There's another post I remember from Robert about the protests in Brooklyn after Kimani Gray's death.
I didn't even know this was happening in my own city until I took over the translation.
When Elaine was denied her visa (*) to come to the US, she posted a blog post with her reaction to it.
She wanted to spread it and I told her immediately that I would translate it.
I was so sad to read his touching story and to learn more about his situation as a colleague and friend of mine that I was inspired to do the best translation I could.
At that moment, I realized the importance of doing translations to give a voice to people who want to tell their stories to the rest of the world.
That's why I love what I do.
JA: Since Spanish is not your mother tongue, how did you get interested in this language?
MB: Everybody asks me that, and I still don't have a good answer! I've been studying Spanish for many, many years, since I was a little girl in elementary school, but I think the first time I got interested was when I was in the sixth grade, and I had a Spanish teacher who was an Orthodox Jew from Panama (that's the beauty of living in New York City!).
Well, I think he saw something in me that even I didn't recognize and it pushed me to keep learning the language.
Thanks to him, I started reading more, listening to more Spanish radio, and taking advanced classes.
But learning Spanish never seemed like that to me.
I studied it because I didn't feel like I was putting in a lot of effort to learn it.
I was just doing something I liked.
I 'm not going to lie .
JA: Since you're a volunteer for GV, what else do you do with your time?
I specifically work on the Au Pair program that gives opportunities for students living abroad to come to the U.S. to care for children and study at the same time.
My position is International Recruitment Coordinator, so I review all applicants' applications and work with our international partners to help them spread the program in their country.
Other than that, I sometimes teach Spanish at a co-educational center in Brooklyn.
JA: I read that you're very interested in gastronomy -- do you cook in your spare time?
MB: Where did you read that?!
I'm interested in gastronomy, but I don't cook as much as I'd like.
I was in Panama for the first time in March (and I had the opportunity to visit another GV'er, the wonderful Ariel Moreno) and I ate my first ceviche.
JA: You're pretty young, what are your plans for the future?
MB: For now, I would very much like to continue working in the field of international education.
I'm fascinated by this theme of mixing and coexisting cultures, which is why I love living in New York.
Then, for the future, I thought about working for an organization that is dedicated to fighting for human rights and/or doing economic development projects.
I also want to continue teaching Spanish.
And obviously I look forward to continuing to work with Global Voices.
I would like to diversify and learn more about other projects within GV as well.
I actually just did some translations for Eddie at Rising Voices and that gave me the opportunity to learn more about that part of the organization.
I have also been volunteering with WITNESS (one of GV's partners that makes videos to fight for human rights) for over a year and plan to continue helping them and doing translations for their initiatives.
In the next video we talk a little bit more about Global Voices and the meeting that brought us to Nairobi.
JA: Anything else to add?
MB: Yes, thanks to Firuzeh and Silvia, with them I hope to continue to develop and grow as a translator.
The truth is, I never thought in my life that as a volunteer translator, I would have the opportunity to be part of this GV family and meet so many amazing people who are changing the world.
It was a dream, really.

Iranian blogger's hunger strike questioned
Mehdi Khazali, source: Doostaranedrkhazali.blogspot.com This is a very good article.
350 bloggers, political activists and Iranian civil society, signed a joint letter last week warning that the life of editor, physician and blogger Mehdi Khazali was in grave danger after he had been on hunger strike for more than 90 days.
But while some bloggers warn that Mehdi Khazali's life is in danger, others question whether he is really on hunger strike.
Khazali is the son of a prominent right-wing cleric and former Guardian Council member, Ayatollah Khazali.
He was arrested along with several participants in a writers' association called Saraye Ghalam.
Iranian blogger Freedomseeker explains the rumors:
... one of the main reasons why people don't believe in Khazali's hunger strike is because over a year ago it was announced that he had been on hunger strike for 67 days.
Soon after being released on the orders of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, leader of the Islamic Republic, Khazali began his weekly mountain hikes and urged people to participate in parliamentary elections.
In the photos that were published of this excursion, there were no visible signs of a prolonged hunger strike and he appeared to be in good shape...
His previous activities with the regime led some people to suspect that the regime was in the process of creating a false opposition.
Not everyone shares this view.
An online petition calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Mehdi Khazali:
Mehdi Khazali, an imprisoned Iranian blogger and physicist, has started his sixth day of hunger strike in Evin prison.
He was last arrested in November 2012, after security forces stormed a writers' meeting.
Kaleme reports that Khazali broke his previous strike when prison authorities promised to fulfill his requests.
Irane Azad writes that the same people who joke about Mehdi Khazali's hunger strike, if he died tomorrow, they would call him a martyr.
These people boycotted the presidential elections in 2009 but after the emergence of the Green Movement (protest movement), they became frontline supporters.
A person is dying in prison".
Syria: Tweeting from the battlefront in Aleppo
Journalist Jenan Moussa is back in Aleppo, Syria, tweeting her experiences as the war between pro- and anti-government forces intensifies.
Moussa's tweets are raw and personal giving readers a glimpse of what life is like for those caught in the crossfire.
Moussa, who is a roving reporter for Arabic Al Aan TV, Dubai, UAE, notes:
@jenanmoussa: It's so nice to be back in #Aleppo and to be reunited with all my friends.
People have adapted to the war.
Dining in Aleppo is being accompanied by the sound of mortars falling in the distance:
@jenanmoussa: It's time to eat here in #Aleppo.
We've got Mexican chicken while the sound of mortars reverberates in the distance.
After a night on the town.
Moussa asks himself:
@jenanmoussa: Good day from #Aleppo.
I couldn't sleep until 6 a.m.
Every time I close my eyes, I imagine bombs falling.
God, how sane are people?
In Aleppo, visit the site where a Scud missile fell 45 days earlier.
He tweeted:
@jenanmoussa: I went to the place where a SCUD missile fell 45 days ago in #Aleppo early today.
There are six bodies missing under the rubble.
@jenanmoussa: In #Aleppo I saw a father with tears in his eyes, sitting on the rubble, still searching for the bodies of his two beautiful daughters and his wife.

Photo shared by @jenanmoussa on Twitter
@jenanmoussa: While with him, the father found the boy's shoes and a lock of hair (women's hair) under the rubble.
Despite the stressful situation, Moussa maintains his sense of humor:
@jenanmoussa: The activists in #Aleppo make me laugh.
Sometimes I'm the only one who wears her flak jacket at home.
They're used to the sounds of war.
And then they go to bed without dinner:
@jenanmoussa: We are not having dinner tonight.
It's not a necessity in a city like #Aleppo.
Good night to you all.
Chinese media authorities have announced restrictions on media and other organizations reporting on unauthorized reporting by foreign media.
The General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television announced the controls in an announcement published on April 16, 2013, less than a day after The New York Times announced it was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for its press report on the hidden wealth of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's family.
In response to this report, the Chinese government blocked the website of the New York Times newspaper, as well as the name of Wen Jiabao of Sina Weibo.
In addition to requiring permission from Chinese media to use foreign journalistic content, the regulations also prohibit organizations and journalists from sharing information on social media, such as the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, which could not normally be included in publications.
The announcement, published by the Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency, says:
All media outlets are not allowed to use foreign media information without authorization.
It is strictly forbidden for journalists and publishers to use the internet as a platform to seek illegal profits; such behavior will be investigated and punished according to the law.
To start an official Weibo account, news agencies must first inform the registration authorities and appoint personnel responsible for publishing reliable information and deleting harmful information in time
Most of the stories on the international pages of the state newspaper are based on international news agencies.
According to The Telegraph, the ban on the use of foreign media could have a big impact on Chinese newspapers.
The news has sparked outrage from many Weibo users, especially among journalists.
Beijing-based journalist Qingdeng Xiaxiangmingbian  wrote:
Internet in China by Karen Roach via Shutterstock
Public opinion supervision is essential for a healthy society, the scale of criticism is the scale of democracy, "if criticism is not free, praise is meaningless".
The correct conclusion is derived from a wide range of voices and not the one chosen by authority.
Internet user Lida Suibi  questioned whether having such control over the media is effective in the long term:
What is harmful information?
I think there's only true and false information.
The purpose of news is to spread the truth, which is the basic need of every society.
Most of the harmful information as defined by the propaganda department in the entire history of the Republic of China turned out to be accurate.
Blocking information and opinions may be effective temporarily, but a policy of self-denial will not work in the long run.
Another net user, "Yun Mu" echoed the sentiment in Chinese:
The more you try to hide, the more exposed you get.
"Ye Laodie aiLvse" wrote sarcastically:
The laws and regulations have seriously lagged behind the development of things!
Diversity of sounds at the Indigenous University of Venezuela
The Universidad Indígena de Venezuela (UIV) is known for its cultural diversity that brings together students from many indigenous communities throughout the country.
During the lunch hour or when walking together between classes, students can be heard talking in the different native languages represented at the UIV.
Preservation of language and culture remains an important pillar for the UIV, and an example of this can be seen on its website.
The school's mission statement is available in Huottöja, Pumé, Ye'kwana, Shiriana and E'ñepa.
Here is the translation in the E'ñepa language, also known as Panare:
A university that educates and educates indigenous youth to serve their communities.
We preserve and strengthen the culture of the original peoples and propose an intercultural and experimental indigenous higher education.
Brewery raises kidnapping against Panamanian football federation
Despite a tweet from President Ricardo Martinelli that stirred controversy, waters are back on track after some days of turbulence between the Panamanian Football Federation and Baru Brewery,
On April 29, 2013, President Martinelli (@rmartinelli) wrote on his Twitter account referring to one of the products of Baru Brewery:
@rmartinelli: I respectfully ask Cerv Panama to withdraw the lawsuit against Fepafut NOW.
Their fight is against all of Panama and now it's with me.
The president's words raised opinions both for and against.
User Joanna (@Buhenona) considered the tweet promoting irresponsibility:

For Jesús Chucho Barrios (@chucho507), however, it is a show of love for the president's selection: @chucho507: @rmartinelli Definitive our President is not a Robot, he expresses and feels like any of us. #ApoyoAlPresi @la_cascara
Beer Barou lifted the embargo against Fepafut on the morning of April 30, as reported by Diario Pro:
In a press conference on Tuesday morning, the manager of the Barú Brewery, Helene Weesie, confirmed that they have notified the Panamanian Football Federation that the kidnapping they had brought on Thursday has been lifted and the process will resume after the 2014 World Cup.
The company also used the Twitter account of Cerveza Panamá (@Cerveza_Panama), its main product, to make it known that despite withdrawing the kidnapping they hope justice will be done:
@Cerveza_Panama: Consumers want transparency and justice, we too, so we will continue with the arbitration process after the World Cup.

Spark13: The fourth global forum on telecentres
Rising Voices is pleased to announce that it will be a media partner of the Fourth World Forum on Telecentres to be held in Granada, Spain from 28-29 May 2013.
This meeting, called Spark 13, will focus on three main topics of discussion: people, innovation and sustainability.
Participants in the Global Telecentre Network, which consists of approximately 500,000 telecentres, serving around one billion users worldwide, will be able to participate in small group sessions, workshops and other participatory activities to explore the topics of discussion.
According to Telecentre.org:
A telecentre is a public place where people can find information, create, learn and communicate with others, while developing digital skills through access to information and communication technology.
Organized by the Telecentre.org Foundation, Telecentres Europe, Fernando de los Rios-Guadalinfo Consortium, and the National Agency of the Korean Information Society, Spark13 is expected to bring together 1,300 participants from around the world.
The winners of the Global Telecentre First Awards will be announced on Spark13.
Awards will be presented in the following categories: Telecentre, Telecentre Manager, Telecentre Network, Telecentre Initiative, Telecentre Innovation, Information and Access Center.
Rising Voices has been very interested in how physical spaces such as telecentres, libraries and hacker labs can be important resources for local communities as a way to encourage citizen participation through the use of digital media tools.
Providing Internet access is certainly an important step, but many of those spaces also provide important training and mentoring for users.
In August 2012 together with New Tactics and Social Media Exchange, Rising Voices organized an online dialogue called "Physical spaces as catalysts for greater digital citizen participation".
During this virtual conversation, we brought together experts and other professionals to share their experiences, challenges and success stories:
Around the world, new physical spaces are emerging that act as catalysts for greater citizen participation through digital technologies.
Community libraries are rethinking their traditional role, and many are offering internet access to their users in order to provide opportunities to gather around local issues, where they can produce and not just consume information.
Telecentres go beyond providing computer access to communities, they offer workshops to train citizens on the effective use of digital technology to promote change.
Hacklabs provide a physical space where activists and technologists can come together to find innovative solutions to local problems.
These are just a few examples of the innovative use of physical space to foster and enhance greater digital citizenship participation.
Before, during and after Spark 13, Rising Voices will be showcasing some of these innovative telecenters that are playing an important role in helping communities access local digital media tools to tell their own stories or participate more fully online.
Mozambique: Development and land acquisition programmes
Amid growing concern about "land grabs" in Africa and the transformation of the smallholder system into large-scale commercial agriculture, a controversial economic development plan leaked out alarmed both Mozambique and Brazil and Japan, two key investors.
According to the Mozambican NGO "Environmental Justice" and other signatory organizations, a leaked copy of the so-called Master Plan of the pro SABANA program dated March 2013 reveals plans for "land grabs" by the governments of Japan, Brazil and Mozambique.

Brazilian activist Fátima Mello explains the pro-SABANA project and tells us the history of the program in an interview with the Humanitas Institute:
Pro SABANA is a cooperation and investment programme involving three countries: Brazil, Japan and Mozambique.
It is an agricultural plan that includes three provinces in northern Mozambique, a 14.5 million hectare region where about 5.5 million farmers live who produce their food within a family farming system.
Pro SABANA is derived from the Prodecer programme which was developed in Mato Grosso, in the Brazilian Cerrado, in the 1980s, with the cooperation of Japan and which had the characteristics we already know in the Cerrado: gigantic large-scale soybean monocultures for export, intensive use of pesticides, elimination of traditional crops, concentration of land, soil pollution and the creation of the economic power of large estates and agro-industries, which translated into political power...
The region, the "Nacala corridor", is the size of Switzerland and Austria combined.
The government and the agencies sponsoring this project had not yet shown maps where farmers and citizens in general could see the lands that would be included.
The peasant organizations were completely excluded from the design of policies and the project.
The National Union of Peasants of Mozambique (UNAC) stated last year:
We, the poor farmers, condemn the way in which the pro-SABANA programme was designed and the way in which it is being implemented in Mozambique, because there was a lack of transparency and the civil society organizations, especially the farmers' organizations, were excluded from the process.

Talking to the farmers of the Nacala corridor it is clear that Brazilians and Japanese are visiting the communities to warn them that the Pro SABANA plan will begin to be implemented.
Then they'll say they consulted civil society.
What you're doing is not consulting.
In March, under increasing pressure, the Mozambican government declared that "dialogue must be permanent".
Brazilian diplomats responded to the request for transparency by assuring that the farmers will be included in the development plans of the Nacala corridor.
The director of the Brazilian Cooperation Agency, Fernando Abreu, said last month that more information about the project would be given and that there were no plans to displace the farmers from the land.
The leak of the programme made it possible to see maps showing the districts that will be targeted for large-scale agriculture for export and allowed civil society organisations to verify exactly which communities would be affected to get a clearer idea of the potential impact.
The document identifies seven areas for intensive development.
Environmental Justice and other signatory organizations describe the type of agriculture that will be launched.
Some of the projects in the programme grant large tracts of land to investors.
The grain production zone projected in Majune district in Niassa province will be managed by a vertical integration company that will manage nine farms of 5,000 ha each, in a region that has 60,000 ha in total, and will rotate maize, soybean and sunflower crops, mainly destined for export.
The programme states that 'the project has a high rate of return; the internal rate of return is calculated at 20,3% and the repayment in 9 years'.
Organizations continue to wonder if there will be any benefit for Mozambicans in the region:
It is significant that only one of the seven regions of the Master Plan is targeted at farmers and family production.
And in this area, the same old and wrong model of development of the green revolution is being proposed.
The Master Plan has not taken into account the needs and capacities of the farmers in the Nacala corridor.
Corporations are the biggest beneficiaries of the Master Plan.
They will have control over the land, production and trade of the food produced, which will be transported through the roads, trains and the port of Nacala, which other foreign corporations will build with public funds from Mozambique and Japan.
The National Union of Farmers predicted last year that many problems would arise from the Pro SABANA program: landless farmers, social unrest, impoverishment, corruption, polluted water and ecological imbalance due to deforestation.
The Union warns that all this could happen if the project proceeds as planned.
Wikipedia appears in Shughni
"Good news Pamiris", writes Bektour Iskender, President of Kloop Media, a news portal and blogging platform in Kyrgyzstan.
"Wikipedia has given permission to start a version of the site in Shughni".
Shughni is one of the main languages spoken in Gorno Badakhshan Province (GBAO), a remote part of eastern Tajikistan dominated by the Pamir Mountains.
Iskender helped local Internet users submit a request to create a Shughni section of Wikipedia after a new media training session in Khorog, the administrative capital of the province, more than two years ago.
"Now begins the small detail of the realization.
Shughni is one of several dialects of the Pamiri language subgroup, a branch of the Farsi language tree, which also includes Tajikistan's state language, Tajik.
Tajik already has a growing presence on Wikipedia, with 10,864 articles, more than Turkmen (4,765), but less than Kazakh and Kyrgyz, (both around 25,000) and far behind Uzbek (120,882).
Non-state languages spoken in post-Soviet Central Asia, such as Uighur, are doing a little less well (2,924), and the Shughni Wikipedia project faces a huge task as well, given that the proportion of the Pamiri community who can still write in the language is very small.
However, Shughni-speaking people who are trying to revive the language in its written form have hope that, when Wikipedia is there, there will be a way.
Mothers of missing Mexicans go on hunger strike
A group of mothers on hunger strike commemorated Mother's Day outside the office of the Attorney General of the Republic in Mexico City and demanded that the Mexican government fulfill its promise to search for their missing children.
According to official reports, more than 26,000 people have disappeared in Mexico between December 1, 2006, and November 30, 2012, during the government of former President Felipe Calderón.
The women have been on strike since May 9, 2013.
Erwin C. in The Latin Americanist blog quoted one of the mothers participating in the hunger strike:
We will not leave until our cases are solved, that the president meets with us and that he gathers a group of swallows to tell us when and how they will start to find our loved ones , declared the hunger striker Margarita Lopez.
Lopez said her daughter disappeared, Yahaira Guadalupe Bahena, was kidnapped two years ago by  armed men who later tortured her to death.
Lopez has urged authorities to open a mass grave where his daughter is allegedly buried, but her requests have been ignored so far.
Lopez was one of the participants in a seven-day hunger strike that took place last November that ended after Mexico City authorities met with the protesters.
Paris Martínez, from the digital publication Animal Político, has covered the hunger strike from the beginning.
In a post, she introduced readers to some of the mothers who participated in the strike, such as Nancy Rosete, whose son Elvis Axell Torres Rosete has been missing since December 29, 2010:
I decided to join the hunger strike because as victims, we are not sure about the actions taken by the authorities.
It is now more than two years since the accident and, even though there are supposedly progresses in the investigations, we cannot verify them.
On May 13, Martínez reported for Animal Político that "apart from a brief exchange of comments by subprocurator Ricardo Garcia Cervantes - the day the protest began- no authority has gone to find out about the orders nor to start a formal dialogue".
He says they're feeling the effects of the lack of food, the temperature drops at night and they don't feel safe.
Erica adds that people have been helping them.
Another protester says they will not leave: "We are not here for one person, we are here for a common goal, which is to search for the missing":
On Wednesday, May 15, Paris reported that a group representing the protesters will visit Los Pinos - the official residence and office of the President of Mexico - to present their written requests to President Enrique Peña Nieto, "to explain the lack of concrete actions in the search for our children".
Bahrain jails six Twitter users for insulting the king
Six Twitter users were sentenced to one year in prison by a Bahrain court on May 15 for allegedly insulting King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa on the microblogging site.
He added that the six were "accused of misusing freedom of expression and opinion publicly and were ordered to be remanded in custody before trial".
The Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights (BYSHR) is demanding:
The immediate release of those arrested for their freedom of opinion and expression and the dropping of all charges against them; an end to restrictions on social media in Bahrain; protection of free exchange of information on the Internet and not its restriction.
If the rest don't shut up, they will be 5. #Bahrain
Author Toby Matthiesen from Cambridge, UK, tweeted:
@TobyMatthiesen: Bahrain court jails 6 Twitter users for a year for "insulting" the King.
And researcher Marc Owen Jones asks the question:
@marcowenjones: They couldn't arrest everyone if everyone insulted the King on Twitter.
Bolivian workers protest for better pensions
Tensions are rising in Bolivia as miners, teachers, health care workers and public university staff - all affiliated with the Central Obrera Boliviana - are on strike demanding an increase in their retirement program.
Several strategic streets remain blocked in La Paz and the neighboring city of El Alto, with limited public transportation circulating on their usual routes.
As the protests intensify, on May 14 teachers and miners detonated dynamite in the streets of La Paz amid demonstrations.

The COB representatives are demanding an increase in their pensions from the current 70 percent to 100 percent of their salary.
They are asking for the 30 to 50 percent increase in their compensation to come from the public funds saved in the Solidary Fund.
Public officials rejected this demand as they consider it compromises the sustainability of the "Solidarity Fund".
Negotiations are intermittent as the government asks COB representatives to suspend protests and blockades.
In addition, junior union police officers and their wives have threatened to join the general protest to demand better retirement programs, arguing the same terms as Navy officers: a retirement with 100 percent of their contributions.
Alleged altercations between police and protesters were reported via Twitter under the hashtag #ConflictosBo.
Despite the conflicting climate, and despite the continuing blockades and protests, dialogue between trade unions and government representatives is expected to resume.

Blogger and analyst Raúl Prada comments on his blog Horizontes Nómadas:
On the other hand, Economy Minister Luis Arce said the government does contribute to the Solidary Fund and "guarantees payment of 70 percent of salaries".
He added that "the government proposal ensures the sustainability of the Solidary Fund for about 30 years and that it financially supports the current and future retirees".
According to the government radio station Patria Nueva, "the authority explained that the COB representatives are looking for a 'political decision' rather than a technique to increase pensions, which is not possible as it would risk the income of all pensioners".
In his blog, Boris Bernal shares the analysis made by the Centre for Studies for Labour and Agricultural Development (CEDLA):
The outlook for young workers and for all those who contribute to the current system as well as to the one in force until 2010 (system administered by the AFP) is more critical, because unlike the old contributors they will have only one source, their contributions, which will make the amount required to retire even more insufficient.
Jorge Rafael Videla, the ideologue of the Argentine military dictatorship, has died.
Jorge Rafael Videla, former president of Argentina, died on May 17, 2013 at the age of 87 in the cell where he was imprisoned.
Videla ruled from 1976 to 1981, during the Argentine military dictatorship, a period that sowed death in the country and left thousands missing.
In 1983 the former dictator was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity.
In 2010 Videla was sentenced to life imprisonment for torturing and shooting 31 political prisoners, and in 2012 he was sentenced to another 50 years in prison for kidnapping newborns during the dictatorship.
In an obituary, BBC Mundo writes: "He was one of the most controversial and hated men in Argentina, and under his regime some 30,000 people were killed or disappeared, according to human rights organizations".
Jose Alejandro Godoy on the page From the Third Floor wrote about the events that occurred during the years that Videla's government lasted:
And regarding his death, he concludes:
Today Videla died in a common prison without privileges.
He'll be buried in a grave, unlike many of his victims, thrown into the sea from a plane.
Repudiated by Argentine society.
With a historic trial that sends him to the most infamous pages of Latin America.
On the other hand, LSO wrote a short entry on its blog, where it refers to Videla as a "dignified officer and soldier who fulfilled the mission that his honor imposed on him".

Under the hashtag #MurioVidela thousands of Argentines have been reacting to the news, as user @Cami-cotarelo:
@Cami_Cotarelo: #MurioVidela is not celebrated, but today after almost 40 years more than 30,000 people rest in peace
Cecilia Saia (@Cecisaia) also expressed the feeling of many Argentines:
@Cecisaia: Today there is one less monster in the world. If there is something after death, let it pay back a thousand times what it did #muriovidela
Adolfo Perez Esquivel (@PrensaPEsquivel), Nobel Peace Prize winner, wrote on his Twitter account:
@PrensaPEsquivel: #Videla died, a man who has done a lot of damage to the country and to humanity.
A cycle has not been closed, we must seek more #truth and #justice.

Yemen: Focus on education!
In a country where the illiteracy rate of both sexes (15 years and above) is almost 40 percent, education and empowerment of women and youth is a must for any concrete development in Yemen.
Activist and researcher Atiaf Alwazir wrote a post titled "Reading should be a right and not a privilege" highlighting the importance of education for women.
Atiaf urged:
Let us all work together to demand concrete changes, and demand that the government reimplement the literacy program as in the past.
We must also make the rights to education and health a political priority at the national dialogue conference (which began in March 2013 and is scheduled to end in August 2013).

Activist and chair of the Rights and Freedoms Working Group on National Dialogue, Arwa Othman highlighted the importance of education but also added in a post on her Facebook page:
Not only is it the right to education as declared by human rights conventions, but these letters must also be included in the school curriculum in the Republic of Yemen (New Yemen) ... and must be taught as a fundamental subject to promote a culture of human rights, tolerance, coexistence, peace, freedom, citizenship, equality, non-discrimination, freedom of difference, freedom of religion, etc... that is, respect for the human being regardless of his color, sex, religion, language, opinion and political principles... etc. We expect this National Dialogue Conference to produce a constitutional text that respects the right of future generations.
VIDEO: Reflective Brazilian boy refuses to eat meat
The YouTube video of three-year-old Luiz Antonio explaining to his mother his reasons for not wanting to eat octopus gnocchi has become the latest must-see video worldwide.
The Brazilian boy says he doesn't like eating meat because "when you eat animals, they die", and he likes to see animals "standing up, happy", explaining that we should "take care of them, not eat them".
The original video in Portuguese, uploaded to YouTube on May 15, 2013, has already had nearly 1,500,000 views in just two weeks.
The English version was published on May 29 and within three days had been viewed more than 900,000 times.
In a country where only a very small percentage of the population has opted for a vegetarian diet, the viral video has ignited a heated debate about vegetarianism on YouTube and Facebook.
Carlos Augusto Andrade explained the reasons:
The video went viral on Facebook yesterday, it's one of those you share with all kinds of people: your mom, your aunt, your fancy friends, your school contacts... And while some groups on Facebook and YouTube have used the video to discuss vegetarianism, we understand that it has gone viral only for what it is: the cute video of a kid who is curiously eloquent for his age and reflects on something that not all of us bother to stop and think about.
Philosophy of Luiz Antonio: "When we eat animals, they die.
I don't like that. I like to see them standing up, happy.
We must take care of them, not eat them".
Inspired by the simplicity of the child's argument, some people have decided to adopt a meat-free lifestyle, like many of the friends with whom blogger Viviane Zandonadi shared the video.
As a food writer, she wondered what she would do with her daughter when she started asking these kinds of questions:
I'm really looking forward to it.
When it's my turn, if Cata questions the logic of the food chain, I have no idea what to tell her.
Luiz Antonio has overturned my arguments.
At the end of the video, Luiz Antonio's mother, moved to tears, asks her son to eat only rice and potatoes.
In the blog Acerto de Contas, Guilherme Carvalho hopes that other parents will start to respect their children's sensitivity, and stop resorting to lies or simplistic arguments to force children to change their minds:
So, in 2013, it's time we stop fooling our kids and repressing their feelings of compassion when they don't show a propensity to eat animals.
Let us respect and value this altruistic and compassionate attitude.
Having a vegetarian child is not a problem, and there is extensive literature today that shows the potential health benefits of this option.
Luiz Antonio's video has left many people moved - and hopeful.
The fear of Caribbean flu originated accidentally in China
What's in a name with a couple of numbers and letters?
It turns out that a lot, when those letters and numbers refer to a strain of the flu virus.
While it is not critical to know your hemagglutinin from your neuraminidase (the two proteins behind the H and N flu naming conventions), as the National Pork Board states in its Influenza Naming Guidelines (PDF): "Knowing the proper name of an influenza virus is important to be factually correct and to avoid misinterpretation and inadequate response".
Case in point: the confusion of the first week of June of avian/swine flu, which had officials from Trinidad and Tobago pointing to Venezuela after (unfounded) concerns over avian flu following a visit by an official delegation led by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and officials in Haiti imposing a ban on the import of meat and chicken products from its neighbor, the Dominican Republic.
The likely source of this confusion, according to Canadian novelist and blogger Crawford Kilian, was a poor translation from Chinese to English by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
The first clue, detected by Kilian on June 6, 2013 and reported in a blog post titled "H7N9 in the Caribbean? Unlikely", was a report in Trinidad Express that Kilian described as "the least likely story since the outbreak began".
The Express article focused on a "suspect" case of bird flu in Trinidad and Tobago, and reported that "questions were beginning to arise" about why members of the 153-person delegation accompanying Chinese President Xi Jinping on an official visit to Trinidad in the first week of June were not screened for bird flu upon entering the country, given that "China is currently battling an avian flu pandemic .
The article quoted the Minister of Health of Trinidad and Tobago as saying that although there was no "outbreak" of bird flu in the country, Trinidad and Tobago was certainly susceptible due to its proximity to Venezuela.
"The idea that senior members of the Chinese government are carrying H7N9 is simply absurd, unless we assume that President Xi and his colleagues also have additional income as chicken traders.
China is not "fighting an avian flu pandemic".
The Chinese deaths reported and the case numbers don't make sense.
And no matter what the heap of cases they have in Venezuela, it's not H7N9 or H5N1".
On the same day, Kilian reported that he had found the likely source of the misinformation: an article by China's official Xinhua news agency, with the headline "Avian flu virus infects 724 people in Venezuela".
The Florida-based blog Haiti Observer made a similar mistake in a June 7 post about the Haitian government's ban on importing chicken and other meat products from the neighboring Dominican Republic, where, according to the article, a warning has been issued "regarding the re-emergence of avian influenza (H1N1 virus)  (highlighted by us).
The mistake was reproduced in the French-language Haitian newspaper, Le Nouvelliste.
Dominican Republic exports 25 million eggs and eight million chickens to Haiti each year.
Although there was certainly an outbreak of the H2N2 strain of avian influenza in the Dominican Republic in 2008, Dominican officials have been adamant that the country is currently free of avian influenza, and claim that the five flu deaths have been due to swine flu, which has no impact on the quality of local meat exports.

Peru celebrates the Festival of the Sun
More than 64,000 people celebrated Inti Raymi, the Festival of the Sun, in the archaeological park of Sacshayhuaman, about 15 minutes from the city of Cusco.
The staging of Inti Raymi began in the temple of Coricancha with the greeting to the Sun and then developed in the Plaza Mayor.
It ended in Sacsayhuamán with the ceremony itself.
The Inca, escorted by his coya and entourage of more than 200 people, entered about 2 p.m. to a platform raised in the middle of the park, after a tour of the stone fortifications.
Various ceremonies were performed, such as the chicha de jora rite, the fire and the sanku, the main food of the Andean man.

June 24 is the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the shortest day and the longest night of the year.
During the time of the Incas, it was the starting point of the new year and according to the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, writer and historian of the 17th century, it was the main festival of the year.
However, in Cusco today, the date is more of a show aimed at both tourists and Cusqueños themselves, for whom it is a point of reference of their local consciousness and which invites enthusiasm and mass participation.
The website Toustodo's Blog explains with reference to the solstice:
Astronomically, the solstice is the time when the Sun reaches its maximum declination north (23° 27) or south (-23° 27) with respect to the Earth's equator.
In the Northern Hemisphere the Sun reaches its zenith at the winter solstice at noon over the Tropic of Capricorn, it happens on June 20 or 21.
In the southern hemisphere, the sun reaches its zenith at noon over the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 or 22.
Solstices originate from the tilt of the Earth's axis over the plane of its orbit.
The Alternative Media blog tells a bit of the story of Inti Raymi:
Since the Spanish conquest, the ceremony was suppressed by the Catholic Church and the Andean society that celebrated the festival of the sun was dismembered.
Inti Raymi was then forgotten, until the mid-20th century when, as an expression of a great movement to revalue native culture in Peru, it was brought back to the scene.
The Inti Raymi in the time of the Incas was a religious ceremony, now it is a theatrical performance, however this expression generates a sense of identity in the people.
The text is in the original Quechua language, with a corresponding Spanish translation to facilitate understanding.
On Twitter there were also comments about the Sun Festival, such as Kristell PerezAlbela (@Kristellpa):
@SanBlasSpanish: Yesterday was Inti Raymi, I hope everyone enjoyed it!
@Vientino: Since yesterday's dawn the festival of the sun, Inti Raymi, was celebrated in the steppes and highlands of the Andes.
Anyel (@AnyelZae) referred to the preferences of some parents when choosing a name for their children:
@AnyelZae: Pucha sometimes parents are stressed when choosing names for their children #intiraymi x example..
@lopezraulh: Yesterday at work we celebrated Inti Raymi.
That's what private names are.
Finally, ronaldchamat (@ronaldchamat) shared the excitement of having lived the Inti Raymi experience:
@ronaldchamat: 5 years ago I was present at #IntiRaymi, what a privilege to have been in that place at that precise moment http://elcomercio.pe/actualidad/159 ...
PHOTOS: Police violence against protesters and bystanders in Rio de Janeiro
This post is part of our special coverage of the Vinegar Revolt in Brazil.
A week ago, on the evening of June 20, 2013, Brazil was rocked by the largest wave of protests in its recent history.
In Rio de Janeiro, an event that began as a peaceful demonstration from the city center to the city hall spread to other neighborhoods and ended in violent clashes between police and protesters.
According to official estimates, some 300,000 people participated in the demonstration in Rio de Janeiro.
Among them is Brazilian photographer Calé who recorded in a photo report the indiscriminate use of rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas by police against unarmed protesters.
The result is the following testimonial and photos, carefully selected by Calé for Global Voices Online:
At the beginning of the demonstration people danced and celebrated on the way to the town hall, there was joy.

There were some minor incidents, such as a fight between supporters of a left-wing party and youths who did not want the demonstration to be exploited or connected to any political party.

The leaders of the demonstration made a human chain in front of the police to avoid conflicts, to ensure that a small group of agitators would not spoil such a pleasant afternoon of demonstrations.

The protesters managed to hold the peaceful protest in front of the city hall, until a 29-year-old bodybuilder, named Gabriel Campos, who is now wanted by police, began insulting the police who were on his horses, despite people asking him to get away from there.
At one point, the protesters asked the police to stop him before it was too late.
The protesters used wooden panels as a shield and threw stones at the police.

When they didn't react, the protesters tried to take justice into their own hands, and a fight broke out.
It was the excuse the police were hoping for.
At the first sign of conflict, tear gas and rubber bullets were fired at the crowd.

At no time was there any intention to invade the town hall, people simply became furious and started to counterattack the police with stones and sticks.
What happened next was the biggest case of police abuse of the decade: Special shock troops evacuated the streets of downtown Rio, from the bohemian neighborhood of La Lapa, which is 2.5 km away.
In response, many shops and buildings were looted and robbed on Presidente Vargas Avenue.

Even after the conflict ended, the police continued to fire tear gas at peaceful protesters returning to their homes, far from the city hall.
There was no distinction between agitators and peaceful people trying to return to their homes.
Since the subway was closed, people had to walk out of the conflict zone.

Since the subway stations were closed, everyone had to walk out of the conflict zone.
At the Carioca station a group was waiting for the doors to open, when the police passed by the Avenida Rio Branco. This station is located on a pedestrian street, perpendicular to the avenue, and when the police were already leaving, someone shouted "Cowards, sons of bitches"... and they then immediately came back and threw gas at the people.

Subway workers quickly opened a small door for people to enter, but ended up creating a trap where people got trapped in a funnel, breathing gas.
Many were nauseated and lying on the floor.

Many who decided to leave the demonstration at the first sign of conflict, and went to the neighborhood of La Lapa to drink a beer, a place that seemed far and safe.
But soon the police arrived and people were trapped in bars and restaurants as chaos dominated the streets.
As people began to insult them, the police also irresponsibly threw tear gas at the buildings.

Yes, there were vandals at the demonstration, who broke and burned things, but most of these acts happened in Presidente Vargas, near the city hall.
In meetings and on social media people now talk about their fear of going out to protest and some want the protests to end.
Only one term comes to mind to explain the behavior of our police: state terrorism.

China orders older children to visit their parents
China has enacted a new law this week requiring older children to visit their parents  frequently .
In China, it is a firm tradition to respect the elderly and care for parents in their old age, but modern lifestyles have caused young people to leave home to pursue their careers and their partners.
The new law says that adults should care for the  spiritual needs  of their parents and that  they should never neglect the elderly , but it does not specify how often they should visit the parents or what punishment they will receive if they do not.
The law comes at a time when China's population is rapidly aging because of the one-child policy.
The journal reported that more than 14 percent of China's population, or 194 million people, are over 60, according to the latest National Bureau of Statistics studies.
In addition, since 2012, China's pension system has been in crisis, with a deficit of $2.9 trillion.
Young Chinese are afraid of having to support government retirees.
The new law has drawn mockery from China's most popular microblogging website, Sina Weibo, where many people joked that the law's enforcement is questionable, and visiting parents should be a moral issue that should be encouraged, not mandated by law.
Some users complained that they don't have enough free time to visit their parents even if they wanted to, while others thought the law was made to compensate for China's pension problem.
Internet personality  Zhuomo Xiansheng  wrote sarcastically:
Image from Sina Weibo
Family ties should be based on spontaneous emotions.
It's funny that the law makes them: it's like requiring couples to have a good sex life after marriage.
Lawyer Yang Lei shared this sentiment:
The question is how to enforce the law.
For example, will the parents be given a fingerprint recorder?
Social security is mainly for civil servants, most ordinary people do not have a pension to rely on.
TV host Cao Baoying thinks the law is a way for the government to evade its own responsibility:
By passing this law, it emphasizes the unilateral civic duty, while also lightening the responsibilities of the government.
An article in ifeng news concludes:
Passing a law promoting filial piety may be effective if children are to be forced to visit their parents, but if outside pressure is not reduced, what is the point of this  filial piety ?
Chile Moves: 'Mapping' the student movement
This post, written by Elisa Moreno Gili, is the second part of a series on the student revolts in Chile.
The original post, "The revolts of Chilean students: Chile Mobilised (2nd part) " was published in Citizen Journalism.
As we already mentioned in the first article on the student movements in Chile and Chile Movilizado, the creation of digital media in this region is already a well-established practice.
In September 2005 citizen journalists from Chile, Peru and Mexico, among others, began to awaken in the Chilean population a desire to communicate beyond traditional media.
Inspired by the South Korean media OhMyNews and driven by former senator Fernando Flores and the Atina Chile movement, they created El Morrocotudo.
This newspaper, which is still in operation today, had an impact on the creation of other local citizen media less influenced by the initial figure of the senator, as is the case of Maulee.
The conception of newsmen in Chile about information management largely reflects the assimilation of citizen journalism among the population.
The use of information published by Chile Movilizado by a traditional media is considered a positive impact that should reinforce the work that the collaborators are doing.
Chile Movilizado is a media that emerges in the wake of student protests in Chile for the reform of the General Law of Education.
From left to right, Juan Jose Peters, Pablo Loyola and Aníbal Vivaceta, creators of Chile Movilizado
The protests, which the education minister Carolina Schmidt calls "illegitimate", have caused more than one student to be injured by the carabiners.
Pablo Loyola claims that the information that the carabiner or security in Chile has is very high.
In other words, the uninformed person is the citizen himself.
This is why it is important to create citizen media such as Chile Movilizado, which allow the population to access current information at the local level.
That social movements on the web are a key factor in Chilean elections is no secret.
Members of the political elite such as presidential candidate Marcel Claude use social media to spread their message, in this case in favor of student movements via Twitter.
Marcel Claude's talk given at the University of the Sea was published in Chile Movilizado as an event of the mobilization.
Chile Movilizado aims to achieve in the future the complete coverage of the protests of the students.
Their desire is to cover both the daily updated information and the related future and past events to be able to make a guide for the protesters.
We want this year to make visible everything that happened in the student movement and for that we have to review everything that happened during the year and everything that will happen.
Saudi Arabia: Women banned from public trials
This entry is part of our special coverage: Reformers on trial in Saudi Arabia
Saudi judges continue to ban women from attending public trials, even if they are close relatives.
Yesterday, the second session of the trial of Umar Al-Saeed, a member of the country's leading human rights organization, the Saudi Association for Political and Civil Rights (ACPRA), was held in the Saudi city of Buraidah.
The session was supposed to be held last Thursday, but was postponed without notice after several activists had traveled to attend.
Al-Saeed, 23, was arrested on April 28 after refusing to be questioned without a lawyer present.
There are currently seven ACPRA members in custody.
At yesterday's hearing, Al-Saeed responded to the charges and accused the interrogator of mistreatment:
I was interrogated with handcuffs on.
The interrogator refused to take them off.
They were too tight and they hurt me.
The interrogator was also provocative, insulting me: "You are a scumbag, you are a criminal" and other things I am not willing to repeat.
Some of those who attended today's session via alajmi01
In addition, Al-Saeed, a university student who was about to graduate when he was arrested, said the interrogator bribed him:
The interrogator Ahmed al-Thukri bribed me: he threatened to deny me my final exams if I did not confess what he wanted.
In an earlier trial, another judge said "the men are enough", which led to another ACPRA member, Abdulkareem al-Khadar, refusing to attend the trial and being arrested.

China: Residents of Jaingmen protest against uranium plant
On July 12, 2012, hundreds of residents of Jiangmen, a city near southern Guangzhou, took to the streets to protest a planned uranium processing plant.
People marching through the city were carrying signs and wearing masks that said, "We want children, not atoms".
The protesters said they were concerned about radiation and possible nuclear contamination.
According to The New York Times, Jiangmen authorities have already signed an agreement with the China National Nuclear Corporation to host the $6 billion project.
The construction is expected to start at the end of this year. The local government announced the project a few weeks ago giving the public 10 days to comment. Officials say the plant does not pose any risks but residents are not convinced.
After the demonstration a press conference was held and the mayor committed to extending the deadline for public comments by 10 days.
Earlier this year, a similar demonstration took place in Kumming, southern China, where residents protested a gas refinery.
The South China Morning Post reported that the demonstrations were organized via messages on Chinese social media: QQ and WeChat.
On China's most popular microblogging site, Sina Weibo, information about the demonstrations was quickly censored.
Some Weibo users managed to access the censored post and photos.
Below are some photos of the demonstrations via Sina Weibo:
The signs say: We want children not atoms.
Pakistani Taliban militant writes open letter to Malala
After teenage activist Malala Yousafzai's speech at the UN calling for free education for all children, Adnan Rasheed, a militant of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Taliban, wrote a letter to the Pakistani urging her to return home and seek education in a local madrasah.
In her letter, Rasheed says she wishes Malala had never been attacked and maintains that the Taliban shot her in the head because it is a propaganda tool used to smear the group, not because she wanted to get an education.
His letter was passed from the Tehreek-e-Taliban of Pakistan to journalists and was published in full by Newsweek Pakistan.
Here is an excerpt:
I hope that the compassion you learned from the Prophet Jesus will be learned by the United States and NATO so that they can stop the bloodshed of innocent Muslims around the world and I would like the same for the followers of Buddha to stop the killing of unarmed innocent Muslims in Burma and Sri Lanka and I hope that the Indian army will also follow Gandhi and stop the genocide in Kashmir.
In the end, I advise you to go home, adopt Islamic and Pashtun culture, enroll in some Islamic female madrasah near your home, study and learn the book of Allah, use your pen for Islam and the plight of the Muslim ummah and expose the conspiracy of the small elite who want to enslave all of humanity by their evil in the name of the new world order.
Rasheed tells Malala that he feels compelled to write to her because they belong to the same Pashtun tribe: "All my emotions are fraternal to you because we belong to the same Yousafzai tribe".
He is a former member of the Pakistan Air Force.

Pavel Durov, creator of Russian social network, will not go to jail...
It seems Pavel Durov can finally return to Russia without the threat of a prison sentence.
This, at least for the time being, seems to be true, now that St. Petersburg detectives have closed their investigation into Durov's alleged involvement in the April 5, 2013, traffic accident that caused a police officer to suffer minor injuries.
Although it was finally determined that Durov was driving the vehicle, investigators announced today that they have been unable to find any evidence to show that he acted in a reckless manner.
Durov ("the Russian Zuckerberg" and creator of the country's most famous social network, Vkontakte) has been living outside Russia since the car accident, probably to avoid being called in for questioning by investigators.
What caused this radical change in the view of researchers?
Did a high-ranking government official intervene to "calm the waters"?
Or has Durov been planning something and the end of his criminal case means he has reached an agreement with the Kremlin authorities, who have recently shown more and more desire to exercise control over Vkontakte?
Durov denied the rumor and insisted he had not been expatriated.
With the threat of prison gone, it's now Durov who has to come back and prove he hasn't left Russia for good.

The Open Labs Community in Albania
This post, by Maria Grabowski, was originally published by the engine room.
This is the second in a series of posts to profile the resources offered in the Social Tech Census.
The Social Tech Census from The engine room is an online database, to support advocates around the world who seek to make better use of digital media and mobile phones.
The Social Tech Census identifies a variety of resources for the use of technology in defense work.
Image from Open Labs courtesy of the engine room
Open Labs started the way a lot of projects do -- a group of people in a bar had an idea. The group of founders agreed that knowledge sharing, open collaboration, open data and open source software are the foundation of a healthy society.
Through hard work and teamwork the idea became an established organization - and in mid-July Open Labs celebrated its 1st anniversary.
A non-profit NGO based in Albania, it is both a hacker lab and a community that is working towards a central goal: sharing knowledge through open technology.
Open Labs hosts weekly events to promote various tools through online technology, meetings, presentations, trainings and workshops.Most events take place in the capital Tirana, but some have even gone as far as Kosovo, Greece and Germany.
A small group of core volunteers pushed the project forward, 45 members participate regularly, and several hundred have attended Open Labs events.
Historically, good quality of life has always been connected with access to knowledge", said co-founder Redon Skikuli when speaking to us from his headquarters in Tirania, Albania.
When Redon came into contact with the free software and free culture movement, he quickly saw the potential of using technology as an open channel for open knowledge. "I love technology and thought getting into open source technology was a way to not just use technology, but use the right technology for solutions".
However, offline meetings remain crucial, and Redon describes Open Labs as "coffee-oriented": "Here, personal chat is much more effective than any other form of communication.
You do business and you create communities in cafeterias".
Six questions from the engine room.
The first.
How do I find the Open Labs?
We have different types of channels: the newsletter, the website and our mailing list.
Our experience, however, is that word of mouth is the most important way for people to find out about us.
2. the
How do I get involved with Open Labs?
The first thing you should do is go to our events or participate in our workshops and projects.
For example, Open Labs translates TED Talks and projects them.
We also have movie nights with creative commons movies - for example we show the documentary The Pirate Bay.
Once a month we also open up the space for interesting projects that are not an Open Labs project.
So if you have an idea for an event related to open knowledge or knowledge sharing, let us know a week in advance and we'll arrange it.
Our online communication is a wall of ideas, and on the ground we do things.
The third.
What kind of resources do they offer?
We have weekly events and workshops in our space in Tirana.
For example, you can learn to use Linux, WordPress or learn about open standards and open data.
4.
What are your biggest challenges?
The funding!
The challenge is not finding funding, the problem is that you quickly end up spending all your time looking for money, instead of actually doing projects.
We are aware that we have grown organically, and our main priority is to build a community that is free and fluid - but another challenge is to survive the vision: to bring more people on board and make a movement in Albania.
- It's five.
What possibilities do you see in using technology to support and mobilise civil society?
Smartphones have given us more computing power and quality cameras than we could have ever imagined.
This has already happened during the uprisings in some countries.
In addition, it is important to know that these devices can also be used by undemocratic governments to track our activities.
That's why the software on these mobile devices has to be free software - free as in free software not free as in free beer.
6 and 6.
How can the Social Tech Census prove useful in your work?
Collaboration and knowledge sharing with other communities internationally is the fun part of our work.
This means that every time someone contacts us and proposes a new project or collaboration, we're more than happy to get our hands dirty.
Each platform/project with the goal of bringing these initiatives together will help the maker scene share more innovations and is more than welcome for me personally and for Open Labs as a collective.

"Elysium" and immigration in the United States.
Elysium, the 2155 film starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, deals a punch to the U.S. health care system, and also offers a glimpse into the country's immigration system if comprehensive reform is carried out.
The film, directed by Neill Blomkamp, takes place on a space station equipped with the latest technological advances called Elysium on an overpopulated and devastated planet Earth.
Matt Damon is the star of "Elysium".
Elysium focuses its attention on an ex-convict named Max (Damon), whose deplorable health condition forces him to seek the services of a criminal political leader who also wants to seize Elysium's exceptional health resources in order to find a cure for Earth's sick inhabitants.
However, both will face the dishonest Delacourt, Elysium's Secretary of Defense (Foster), who ruthlessly at all costs prevents the inhabitants (or "illegals", as the film defines them) from entering Elysium.
At the beginning of the film, Delacourt orders a spaceship full of immigrants to be mercilessly shot down in an attempt to enter Elysium.
Although not in the same way, enforcement of the law has been a decisive component in the passage of Bill S.744 on 27 June 2013, with the aim of halting the influx of immigrants at the border.
As Elysium unravels, one might think that the main reason these "illegals" want to flee planet Earth for a more comfortable life in Elysium parallels the reason why many immigrants decide to cross the border and find a better life in the United States (of course, the US is the Elysium for all the immigrants hoping abroad).
The film also shows that immigrants go to Elysium to find a better healthcare system, but they need to be citizens of Elysium to be able to benefit from it.
In real life, many undocumented immigrants face the same problem, since they have no access to health care.
Before getting into the weeds that underlie the immigration debate, blogs like ThinkProgress explain that Elysium falls short in explaining why the healthcare system on the space satellite is better than the one on Earth:
But the more you think about it, the more you convince yourself of how Elysium is not able to tell the truth, of how things really are because it is not able to answer a simple question: Why is there so little health care on Earth in the world of Elysium?
The film shows us many ways in which life on Elysium is more comfortable and satisfying than on Earth, but Blomkamp focuses almost exclusively on the inhabitants of planet Earth who aspire to reach Elysium primarily to access medical equipment capable of curing them, even from serious illnesses, with a simple, quick scan".
ThinkProgress goes on to say:
And at the end of the movie, they get it.
Spider and Max download a program into Elysium's main computer that turns everyone on Earth into citizens of Elysium and thus enables them to be scanned by the devices, shuttles full of these equipment are sent to Earth, where people of all races, sexes and religions can use them.
The problem does not seem to be a shortage of medical equipment.
There could be other reasons for this restriction in health care, but whatever the reasons may be are not clear in the film".
The application of this last paragraph to real life may mean that the legalization of the immigration status of 11 million people in the United States will ensure a better quality of life for all of them.
As the Immigration Policy Center points out:
Granting healthcare to legal immigrants not only strengthens the system, but is a crucial part of their integration into American society.
In addition to working, paying taxes and learning English, immigrants should be able to pay their dues and receive affordable health care, like everyone else".
When asked if the film shows what human conditions will be like 140 years from now, Blomkamp replied:
No, no, no, I'm not going to.
This is not science fiction.
This is now".
With regard to immigration, Blomkamp may be right.
Elysium portrays the United States as a country that has been overtaken by Latin Americans and whose native language de iure is Spanish, at a time when local office and factory insignia contain Spanish writing, and where law enforcement is referred to as "Police".
Finally, there is something we can deduce from the film and that is that no society, no matter how perfect it claims to be, can turn a blind eye to its inhabitants and their needs - and addressing the issue of immigration is the first step towards understanding human history.

Tropical Storm Maring (internationally known as Trami) caused flooding in the Manila metropolitan area and neighboring provinces of the Philippines leaving a total of 8 dead, 41 injured and 4 missing.
According to a government report, 125,348 families (602,442 people) were affected by the storm.
As of 20 August afternoon, 40,837 people remain refugees in 198 evacuation centres.
The flood caused damage to 65 main roads that were impassable.
A total of 162 flights (59 international and 103 domestic) were canceled due to the storm.
The Philippines used the hashtags #marigngPH and #floodPH to monitor all flood events in Manila and nearby regions.
Below are some photos posted on Facebook and Twitter that show the scale of the disaster caused by the floods.

Four hundred Cuban doctors arrive in Brazil
David Oliveira de Souza, a doctor and professor at the Syrian-Lebanese Hospital Research Institute, sent an open letter to the more than 400 Cuban doctors who have recently arrived in Brazil and who are the first group of a total of 4,000 doctors who will arrive in the country before December this year.

The letter, published by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, states:
You will be compensated, in large measure, for the warm welcome in the communities you will now care for.
According to Oliveira de Souza, in states like Sergipe it is easy to move from the capital to the Interior, but still there are hundreds of idle jobs, even in health units equipped and in good condition.
In view of the deficit of 14,500 gallons in the South American nation, Dilma Rousseff's government approved the "More Doctors" program, which will hire doctors from Spain, Portugal and Cuba, among other nations.
Recently, one of the main criticisms of the hiring of Cubans is that they "were being exploited".
In response to this argument, Oliveira de Souza states in her letter:
On behalf of our people and most of our doctors, I can only say with conviction: a fraternal embrace and many thanks.
'Million-person march' against corruption in Philippines
Mass protests, the largest since President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III took office three years ago, rocked the Philippines on National Heroes Day, August 26, when hundreds of thousands expressed outrage at government corruption and called for a total abolition of donating money to candidates for political purposes.
Police estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 people gathered at Rizal Park in Manila, the country's capital, while thousands more held mass actions in other cities nationwide.
Public outrage over this kind of corrupt donations came after the revelation of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), which is allocated to lawmakers in Congress and the Senate to use on their favorite projects.
For some time now, the PDAF has been the target of criticism as a site of official corruption.
But public outcry increased after an informant identified businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, who is alleged to have conspired with lawmakers to pocket 10 billion Philippine pesos (about $22 million) through the fund.

From @muntingprinsipe
Called the Million People's March , the idea behind the meeting on Monday 26th in Rizal Park, where middle class people predominated, originated from interactions on social media among concerned netizens on Facebook and Twitter.
The concept for a one million-person march against donating money to political candidates began with a Facebook post by music producer Ito Rapadas:
What we need is a MILLION MAN March by combative Filipino taxpayers, a day of silent majority protest that would demand that all politicians and government officials (whatever political stripes or colors they may have) stop pocketing our hard-earned money through these corruption traps and other creative criminal acts.
This was shared by several netizens, including her friend Peachy Britania, who suggested that the mass action be held on August 26, National Heroes Day.
Protests were also held in various cities nationwide, especially in Ciudad Bacolod, Ciudad Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Ciudad Dagupan, Ciudad Davao, Ciudad Digos, Ciudad Dumaguete, Ciudad Iloilo, Ciudad Naga and Puerto Princesa in Palawan.

The protest action was held.
On the day of the protest, President Aquino and his spokesmen announced that the government was on the same side as the protesters.
Here are some reactions on Twitter:
You don't decide where we want our money to go.
We are.
We want our money for national development, social service and security.
Abolition of pigs.
If Noynoy and the protesters are on the same side, why did people still go out after his press conference?
Abolish vs. change the name.
Pixel Offensive said that if the president is truly on the side of the people against paying this fund, he should speak out about the following:
1) Abolition of this fund, without exception.
Kulangot lang ito kumpara sa pig nya. This is the first time I've seen you.
2) Your staff would not tweet anything against the demonstrations.
This only exposes the thinking of the inner circle of the president.
Let's just raise this discussion a little bit, shall we?
You expect a ranch president to serve the people?
Critics argue that this presidential corruption that consists of one-time payments, whose disbursement is left to the discretion of the president and his executive department, is worth more than 1.3 billion pesos.
Hours before the anti-corruption rally, presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte tweeted a link to an article that described outrage over this payment to politicians on campaign as a "nice but out of place statement".
Are we thinking about the next step, like Juan Tamad, waiting for someone to solve our problem?
Anger is the path to the dark side, and that's why hypocrisy and outrage must stop, and why we need to change the pace and solve the problem of how the government spends our money.
Another presidential spokesman, Edwin Lacierda, also tweeted a link to the same article and joked "who says blogging is outdated!"
For his part, the undersecretary of Communications, Manuel Quezon III, asked the Catholic Church, which urged the people to attend the massive action, why it remained silent during the term of former president Gloria Arroyo.
The officials have denied tweeting against the demonstration.
But in the end, no amount of public relations can suppress public outrage over the massive looting of people's money by government officials and their cronies, while millions of Filipinos suffer from hunger, unemployment and extreme poverty.
Mexico: "Reform that has nothing to do with education"
Teachers in the National Coordinator of Education (CNTE) have protested numerous times since August 17 against the educational reform promoted by President Enrique Peña Nieto that includes, among other controversial points, teacher evaluation.
Many have used social media to show their animosity towards the blockades, but now it is the teachers who have decided to explain their demands through this medium hoping that the public will see beyond the chaos caused by the marches and support their cause.
This is the case of this rural teacher from Oaxaca, who eloquently tells why he left his family and work behind to protest what he considers a "supposed educational reform, which has nothing educational".
They suggest Obama return the Guantanamo naval base to Cuba.
Former U.S. Representative in Cuba Michael Parmly suggested to President Barack Obama that the Guantanamo military base be returned to the island authorities, among other recommendations cited in a 26-page report seen by Reuters news agency that will be published shortly at the Fletcher Forum of World Affairs.

Negotiating an agreement with Cuban President Raul Castro on the naval base could help establish a direct relationship with the Cuban government and citizens, believes Parmly, who was head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana from 2005 to 2008.
Most of the prisoners at Guantanamo could be transferred to prisons on U.S. soil, while the most problematic cases would remain on the island, Parmly says.
According to the former official, the naval base is a "historical anomaly":
Colombia prepares for a national cacerolazo
At 6pm, Colombian time, on September 4, 2013, a national cacelorazo is scheduled.

For Camila Andrea, the protest is a call to have a better country:
#CacerolazoFor having a better country for everyone and for people with a future!!  Camila Andrea (@CamiAndreDiaz) September 4, 2013
And in Catalina Gualdron's opinion, the protest is justified by the complex situation Colombia is living through:

PHOTOS: Thousands of fishermen devastated by oil spill in Cebu, Philippines
More than 90 people died a few weeks ago when a passenger ship sank off the coast of Cebu province in the Philippines after colliding with a freighter.
However, the impact of the collision is still visible after 120,000 litres of crude from the sunken ship spilled on the shores of the coastal municipalities of Talísay, Córdoba and Lapulapu.
In addition to affecting more than 300 hectares of mangroves, the oil spill has also displaced more than 3 000 fishermen and threatened to undermine the area's tourism industry.
Lizzy Oi has visited a fishing village in Cordoba and shared her testimony:
Córdoba has thus awakened after the oil spill ruined the main livelihood of thousands of fishermen in the municipality.
80% of the population depends mainly on fishing for their daily needs.
Now that everything has faded away with the devastating man-made tragedy, people seem to be losing hope in knowing that the problem will drag on for many months and even years.
Cordoba, Cebu, you know.
This photo is from Lizzy Oi's Facebook page.

The oil spill has also reached the beaches of Mactan.

meylou has also shown her support for those affected:
It's a real tragedy.
My condolences to the families who have lost their loved ones.
I am sorry for the barangayes who have been affected, for the fishermen who cannot go out fishing and for the dead mangroves.
It will take many years to recover them, but cleaning will have to be done diligently or more mangroves will perish :-(.
Sadaba: The oil spill from Cebu has occurred in high season of fruiting of the mangroves.
The population immediately began cleaning up.
Tishiana Mann observed some ingenious ways to remove crude oil from water:
Many people have invented interesting ways to help contain the spill of crude oil: for example, local hairdressers have sent human hair and coconut distribution center business owners have sent piles of coconut shells to act as absorbers.
They even thought about using sawdust to absorb the oil, but when they threw it in the water, the wind blew it away.
Donations and free haircuts were started to help in the cleanup run, and even the concerned population collected chicken feathers.
Among other relevant news... I wanted to cut my hair and donate it to the oil spill in Cebu last weekend.
I was shot.
He's proactive now.
Shopping malls are also encouraged to donate stockings to use in hair containers to contain the oil spill in Cebu.
The loss of life from disasters at sea is staggering.
The consequences of damage to the marine environment are enormous.
If people continue to put their bodies and lives at risk when they embark and sail through our waters, it is clear that the need for stricter maritime regulation and management of maritime transport is not only imminent but also absolute.
No Liberian student gets into college
This year, as Liberia marks the tenth anniversary of the General Peace Agreement signed in Accra that ended a 14-year civil war, nearly 25,000 high school graduates failed the entrance exam to the University of Liberia.
It was the first time that no candidate had passed and been admitted.
The President of Liberia, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nobel Peace Prize winner, admits that the education system in Liberia is "a mess".
Public domain photo from the US State Department.
The BBC reported that Education Minister Etmonia David-Tarpeh found it extremely difficult to believe that any candidate would pass, so she is expected to meet with university authorities to discuss the matter.
She describes this failure rate as "mass murder".
However, private advisor James Dabor Jallah, hired by the university to handle the entrance exams, confirmed the news and added that the days when students were admitted to the University of Liberia through bribes or connections are over.
Through Twitter, the world has already expressed disbelief at the news.
This is how Professor Calestous Juma (@calestous) from Harvard Kennedy School and originally from Kenya put it:

Leopold II, King of the Belgians, was the de facto sole owner of the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908, now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Saran Kaba Jones (@sarankjones), a water rights advocate and social entrepreneur, said it was sad but not surprising:

"Central Asia is also looking at [Syria]"
As the US and Russia discuss the way forward in Syria, Central Asian governments are closely following the situation, Nathan Barrick writes on Registan.net:
Russia chooses to focus on the perspective that the Syrian government is waging a battle against Islamic extremists and this message is likely to resonate with Central Asian governments.
Central Asia's official silence on Syria should not hide real sympathy with Russia's perspective...... Central Asia is also watching... not because it is trying to develop and acquire chemical weapons to use against its population, but because it highlights the security they can place in a security partnership with the United States, or it could even reconsider it and partner more closely with Russia".
Egypt's #SpyDuck ended up being dinner
A stork - looks like Menes.
This image is taken from Wikimedia Commons, used under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License.
A stork accused of being a duck and spying, and arrested in Egypt, has ended up being part of an Egyptian family's meal.
On August 31, news broke that Egypt had arrested a spy duck, with a suspicious device attached to its feathers.
Later, it turned out that the duck was a stork, called Menes, and the tracking device was for a study.
On September 4, Mostafa Hussein announced that "the wrongly accused stork is free":
The wrongly accused stork is free.
The euphoria was short-lived.
Blogger Zeinobia reported that:
After being accused of espionage and spending a day in detention in Egypt, she was released alone to meet her fate!
It was hunted and eaten by a Nubian family from southern Egypt!
On Facebook, the Egyptian Nature Conservation Society added:
After being released from the Salugah and Ghazal Protected Area several days ago, Menes flew to a nearby Nile island, where she was captured and killed to be eaten later.
The post explains:
And the problem is bigger - and more complicated:
Egypt has long suffered from uncontrolled poaching.
However, it is always important to balance the needs of local communities with the conservation of nature and biodiversity.
The post concludes:
The whole region has a long way to go, especially in raising awareness among the population not to hunt migratory birds.
The first six months of Nicolas Maduro as president of Venezuela

PHOTOS: Typhoon survivors in Philippines desperate for food, water and help
A street in Balangiga, Samar, one of the worst affected provinces.
Photo by the Autonomous Mr Abellar Amano, from Facebook.
Aid is not being distributed adequately and quickly to the communities that survived Super Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) in the Philippines.
Many survivors are complaining that the government's aid packages have not yet reached them.
Haiyan hit the Visayas Islands on Friday, November 8, and triggered a tsunami that killed more than 1,500 people.
But the casualties could be higher as the situation in the remote coastal towns has not been revealed.
Because of damaged roads, rescuers and support groups were unable to access these communities.
Desperate for food, some survivors ransacked supermarkets and rice warehouses.
Looting was reported in Tacloban City and several towns in Leyte province.
In response, the government promised to speed up the distribution of relief items as it deploys more police forces to restore order in the typhoon-affected communities.
Meanwhile, the shopping panic in Samar continues:
Anxiety hangs over Samar's Calbayog city as supplies are running low; panic is seen shopping at most grocery stores.
When they steal TVs and washing machines, that's looting.
It is really sad that it has reached a point where the victims are looting shops and ATMs:))) planning a distribution of aid this week.
Looters throw items from a warehouse in Guiuan, East Samar, after rescuers struggled to bring aid to survivors.
Through Randy Felix Malayao's Facebook page, a survivor asks the public not to be harsh in judging looters:
Don't be so quick to judge looters, I was a looters.
I looted medicine for the Red Cross, milk and food for the children.
I walked for four hours and dug two feet of empty plastic bottles to at least get something to drink and take home.
The people who took flat screen TVs were the same people who offered me some drinks and some lugaw.
Those who looked like ex-convicts offered me something to eat.
Most of the time they're willing to lend a hand when you say you really need something.
What they didn't show on the news is how people helped each other in the midst of the catastrophe.
Don't call them looters, writes Martha Villarosa:
Are they looters?!
No one has the right to call them that.
Just imagine how painful it is, as many of them have lost their homes, their loved ones have passed away, there is nothing to eat or drink.
Just be thankful that we're alive, safe and still enjoying our lives.
Let's be positive about this.
All our compatriots need our support and prayers to help them get through this.
Many roads were damaged by Typhoon Haiyan.

The country's top education official, Brother Armin Luistro, sends this message to educators:
Let's deal with the people first.
Don't worry about property damage. We'll see about that later.
The worst thing is counting down buildings and fallen trees and not counting people.
Second, let's get our kids back to school.
The best way for children to recover is to get them back to their routine as soon as possible  and that is to get them back to school.
There's no need to start classes right away.
Let them play.
Have activities.
Atom Araullo reports that communication signals have been partially restored in Tacloban:
Telecommunications services are slowly being restored.
The devastation is overwhelming.
The people here need all the help they can get.
More and more Filipinos are participating in the rescue operations:
It is so touching to see so many people putting forth their best efforts in the relief operations.
It's times like this that I thank you for social media.
Guiuan, east of Samar.
This is a public school and evacuation center.
It's all that's left now.
Palo, the Leyte campus of the University of the Philippines, was damaged by the storm.
It's all that's left now.
Do you know what resilience really means?
It would be a month or two from now when everyone is gone, all the free food stops coming, people are back to fending for themselves and realizing what happened and what they have in reserve will hit them like a gust of wind with all its force.
Then people will know what resilience really means.
Tunisian rap song becomes an anthem for youth
On September 14, Tunisian artists Hamzaoui Med Amine and Kafon released their new song 'Houmani'.
With over 3.4 million views so far on YouTube, the song has become an anthem for young Tunisians.
The video clip, which cost only 250 dinars (about $150 USD) to produce, depicts residents of a disadvantaged neighborhood as they move through their daily lives.
In the Tunisian dialect the adjective Houmani derives from the noun Houma, which could be translated as a 'working class district'.
Houmani refers to someone who lives in a working class area.
A working class area in Tunisia is called Houma...
And rap talks about these poor-class neighborhoods that officials and celebrities rarely talk about.
An alien is listening to Houmani.
In the song Hamzaoui and Kafon describe what life is like for young people living in working class neighborhoods in Tunisia.
The lyrics to the song say:
We're living like trash in a dumpster... it's suffocating here
Blogger Mehdi Lamloum explains how Houmani has been successful:
Houmani, a simple song with a strange title and a low-cost produced video clip has created huge debates in recent weeks...
That's the interesting thing about this play.
She quickly entered popular culture generating conversations and discussions on many topics...
The issue of slums versus affluent neighborhoods even though it is not directly addressed in the song is very much present.
A question that arises in this regard is... who has the right to listen to Houmani?
Do the inhabitants of "rich neighborhoods" have the right to identify with the daily life that Houmani relates?
He adds:
Those who criticize the song from a musical point of view are perfectly right.
But they should see what lies beyond the piece: a work that has succeeded in transcribing what Tunisians feel whether or not they come from slums, live or not the everyday life described...
Michelle Bachelet wins Chilean election but goes to second round

With 46.7% of the vote, former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet was the clear winner of the Chilean presidential election, but the former UN Women executive director will have to go to the second round in December against conservative candidate Evelyn Matthei, who came in second with 25% of the vote.
Bachelet's victory was no surprise, even some polls had projected that she could achieve an absolute majority in the first round.
But on social media, during the campaign, users have expressed their dissatisfaction with Bachelet's candidacy and her previous administration.
After yesterday's results, many are commenting on the difference between the views of social media and the reality in Chile:

Thousands of young people are without scholarships in the Dominican Republic
The Technological Institute of the Americas (ITLA) and the Dominican Institute of Telecommunications (INDOTEL) signed a cooperation agreement in 2011, called the Fund for Academic Excellence aimed at outstanding high school and public school students, which aims to graduate hundreds of students in a two-year period to meet the labor demand of the telecommunications industry nationwide.
This is in line with the statement by the President of the Republic, Danilo Medina, that education is the basis for development.
The situation is similar to what happened to Erasmus students in Spain.
Despite the news that the agreement had been dissolved, on 5 September this year, the beneficiaries of the programme received an e-mail from the ITLA administration announcing the following:
With regard to students currently holding the scholarship from the Fund for Academic Excellence, INDOTEL has provided that it will initiate a "rigorous evaluation" of their cases to determine which students meet the requirements to maintain the benefit of their scholarship or not.
13009068 received on 5 September in the afternoon, INDOTEL terminates the scholarship project called Fund for Academic Excellence.
In response to this situation, the Blue Youth movement has emerged, which defines itself as: a group of young people determined to fight for the injustices committed in the education system.
Their purpose is to be heard and with unity and effort to get the patronage of various institutions and personalities to provide full scholarships to students with limited resources from all over the country.
His supporters have expressed their disagreement with the decision on social media:
There are dreams and entrepreneurial people to make things better but they come and take away our scholarship O.o #JuventudAzul  Cristy Taveras (@CristyGab8) November 15, 2013

We need education, not posters. #JuventudAzul  O H! (@SrJavierRamos) November 16, 2013
Even the director of the ITLA, José Armando Tavárez, was quoted as saying:
#ITLA wants to give free public technological education.
We need budget. #ITLA scholarships for all youth #JuventudAzul  José Armando Tavarez (@jtavarezr) November 13, 2013
However, INDOTEL claims that a budget cut of almost 50% is one of the main reasons for this measure, in addition to some discouraging statistics regarding the effectiveness of the programme, such as: Of the 2,163 students of that institution, 1,062 (47%) deserted or lost the benefit of the scholarship for not maintaining the required indices.
The report also highlights the need to ensure that the programme is implemented in a way that is consistent with the objectives of the programme and that the programme is implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the programme.

GV Face: US dreams of immigration reform
"The time is now" immigration reform rally in Washington, DC (April 10, 2013).
By David Sachs/SEIU (CC BY-NC-SA) Is immigration reform just a dream?
Millions have emigrated to the United States, for family, opportunities or in search of a better life.
There are currently 40 million immigrants in the United States, of whom an estimated 11 million live and work illegally.
At this week's GV FACE, I spoke with activists and experts about the immigration reform movement and discussed what the proposed reform can mean for the daily lives of millions of immigrants.
Activist Marisol Ramos talks about the various movements of young immigrants online and offline.
Alfonso González, author of Reform Without Justice and a member of the editorial committee of the North American Congress on Latin America (NACLA), questions whether temporary migrant worker programs can solve the immigration blockade.
Global Voices author Robert Valencia talks about the various times when reform seemed within reach but didn't materialize.

17 pieces of wisdom from Nelson Mandela that we should all read
Nelson Mandela was the first democratically elected president in South Africa.
Photo published by South Africa The Good News with Creative Commons license (CC BY 2.0).
Nelson Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa and winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, died on December 5, 2013 at the age of 95.
Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his fight against South Africa's apartheid system. He was released from prison in 1990, and became president four years later, leaving office after serving only one term, a rare gesture in African politics.
One of his most famous phrases comes from a defiant speech he made in court during his Rivonia treason trial in 1964, where he said:
I've fought against white domination and I've fought against black domination.
I have cherished the ideal of a free and democratic society where all people live together in harmony with equal opportunities.
It's an ideal I hope to live for and achieve.
But if necessary, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.
In addition to his speech at the Rivonia trial, Mandela leaves many memorable and wise phrases he said throughout his life.
On judgments
Don't judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell and got back up. - Nelson Mandela
I am not a saint, unless you consider a sinner who keeps trying to be a saint. - Nelson Mandela
About the hate
Hate clouds the mind.
Leaders cannot afford to hate.  Nelson Mandela
If you can learn to hate, you can learn to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than the opposite.
No one is born hating... _Nelson Mandela
About forgiveness
You will accomplish more in this world through acts of kindness than through acts of retaliation.
About the sport
Sport can awaken hope where before there was only despair.
About leadership
He leads from behind and lets others think they're in front.
On racism
I hate racism because I consider it a barbarism, whether it comes from a black man or a white man.
The determination
It always seems impossible until it's done.
The brave man is not the one who has no fear, it is the one who conquers that fear. - Nelson Mandela, Long March to Freedom, 1994.
Honor belongs to those who never abandon the truth, even when things seem dark and gloomy. - Nelson Mandela 1969.
On the freedom
Because being free is not simply throwing off chains, but living in a way that respects and encourages the freedom of others.
On education
Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.
About the prison
They say no one really knows a nation until they're inside its prisons.
About the duty
When a man has done what he considers to be his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace ~ Nelson Mandela.
Iceland mourns first case of man killed by police
Police officers in Reykjavik, Iceland.
Photo by Christopher Porter on flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) This is a free, open source project.
This article and radio report by Traci Tong for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on December 3, 2013 and is republished as part of a content sharing agreement.
This week there has been an unprecedented headline in Iceland: a man was killed by police shooting.
"The country is in shock.
This is not the case in our country", said Thóra Arnórsdóttir, news editor of RUV, the national broadcaster in Iceland.
The man, who started shooting at the police when they entered the building where he lived, had a history of mental problems.
It is the first time anyone has been killed by armed police in Iceland since it became an independent republic in 1944.
The police don't even usually carry guns.
Violent crime is almost non-existent in the country.
"The country does not want its police force to carry weapons because it is dangerous, it is threatening", Arnórsdóttir says.
Weapons are used for hunting as a sport, but we never see weapons".
In fact, Iceland is not anti-gun. In terms of gun ownership per capita, Iceland ranks 15th in the world. Yet this incident is so rare that the neighbors of the slain man compared the shooting to a scene from an American movie.
The Icelandic police department stated that the police involved will receive psychological support and has already apologized to the family of the deceased  though not because they did anything wrong.
"It's respectful", says Arnórsdóttir, "because nobody likes to take another person's life".
There are still many questions to be answered, including why police did not try to negotiate with the man before entering the building.
"One of the great things about living in this country is that you can go into parliament and all they ask is that you turn off your mobile phone so as not to disturb the parliamentarians while they are speaking.
There are no armed guards following the Prime Minister or the President.
We don't want that to change".
Peruvian Twitter users remember song dedicated to Mandela
Following the release of the recently deceased South African statesman Nelson Mandela, in the 1990s, the Spanish-Peruvian musician Miki Gonzáles composed the song "Liberaron a Mandela".
Peruvian Twitter users recall:
Uruguay became "a sanctuary for whales and dolphins"
Photo shared by @PaipoUruguay on Twitter.
Uruguay passed law 19.128 in September, declaring the waters under Uruguay's jurisdiction as "Whale and Dolphin Sanctuary".
The law applies in the territorial sea and the Uruguayan exclusive economic zone and prohibits hunting, pursuit, appropriation, fishing or processing of any cetacean.
It also includes a ban on the transport and landing of live whales or dolphins, both by national and foreign flag vessels.
The law provides for penalties for those who do not comply.
Exceptions are considered in cases of health or scientific interest, as endorsed by national authorities.
The law also provides for harassment, aggression or harassment that could result in the death of cetaceans.
The law was unanimously approved by the Legislative Power and was promulgated on September 13 by President José Mujica.
The law 19.128 would come to strengthen existing conservation policies, carried out by the Ministry of Livestock Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP) and the National Directorate of Aquatic Resources (DINARA).
The director of DINARA, Daniel Gilardoni, declared to the Presidency: For our country the most important threat is navigation, much of the strandings are due to the collisions of boats with cetaceans .
Declaring Uruguayan waters a whale and dolphin sanctuary would have an economic benefit, as noted in the article "Uruguay whale and dolphin sanctuary: Let the cetaceans come to me" on the Whales in Uruguay blog.
Popular opinion was raised in favour of the law.
On social networks, there were plenty of demonstrations of goodwill towards the transformation of Uruguay into a "Whale and Dolphin Sanctuary".

Ecuador: Authorities raid house of legislative advisor Fernando Villavicencio
At the request of the Attorney General of the State of Ecuador, Galo Chiriboga, in the evening hours of December 26, 2013, members of the Intervention and Rescue Group (GIR) raided the home of Fernando Villavicencio, advisor to the assemblyman of the Ecuadorian province of Zamora Zhinchipe.
Villavicencio is one of the advisers of assemblyman Cléver Jiménez, a member of the Pachakutik (PK) party.
Together with activist Carlos Figueroa, they were sentenced to 18 months in prison in early 2013 for the crime of insulting the Ecuadorian president, Rafael Correa.
In 2011, the three accused the president of allegedly ordering the armed raid on the Police Hospital during the revolt of 30 September 2010.
The operation at Villavicencio's house, carried out by judicial order of the judge of the National Court Jorge Blum, lasted until 3:00 in the morning.
The prosecutor's office was looking for information contained in Villaviencio's computer, memory devices and personal cell phones, which were seized as part of an investigation into alleged spying on emails from high-ranking government officials.
The investigation also includes assemblyman Clever Jiménez, whose office inside the Assembly was also raided.
Jiménez had publicly admitted to possessing several emails from President Rafael Correa and Vice President Jorge Glas, related to the Chevron case.
After the above, the reactions on social networks were many, like the Guayaquil citizen initiative Alfredo Velazco (@alfredovelazco), who tweeted and wrote on Facebook about the contradictions of a double discourse of what is happening in the country:
11.- All this is another abuse of the State, which will be covered up with an infamous campaign against Villavicencio in public media and networks.  Carlos Andrés Vera (@Polificcion) December 27, 2013
Diana Amores Moreno (@Diana_Amores) is ironic about the National Secretary of Communication (SECOM) about the raid on Villavicencio's house:
Is "chat" a dirty word in Iran?
WeChat blocked
Internet providers blocked access to WeChat according to reports on various news sites and blogs.
WeChat is an application that allows you to connect with social networks.
Although the president of Iran himself and a couple of his ministers personally use different social media platforms to communicate with their followers, Iranians are banned from accessing sites like Facebook.
Iran Vatan Dust tweeted about the news:
The next thing they're gonna try is to filter people's thoughts.
Faaar Ranak tweeted:
It doesn't matter if you use WeChat or not.
The main problem is they're leaking it.
Iranian blogger Gilboygreen writes:
Why did the Islamic Republic of Iran block WeChat?
Because they're afraid of people talking to each other.
Today, it possibly appeared to symbolize dialogue.
Why aren't people allowed to talk to each other?
The authorities should answer that question.
When a channel for dialogue, exchange of ideas and communication is blocked, how do people expect to solve society's problems through dialogue?
Don't be afraid of the word "chat".
Conversation is a simple human act, accepted in different societies.
Another blogger, 1ironi, writes:
According to the unwritten law, any product - including food - that arrives in Iran for the first time from abroad is prohibited...
There are several examples of these types of products that have become targets, such as eating tomatoes, watching TV.
Several lawmakers increased pressure to block WeChat, but we can still use it via psiphon.
Iran-man-massoud wrote a blog ironically pointing to Iran's new president:

With drums and dancing, the "Carnival of the Country" began in Gualeguaychú
The carnival festivities are coming up and the devil is partying.
In many cities it starts well in advance, giving rise to pre-carnival festivities.
In Argentina the most popular carnival is celebrated in the city of Gualeguaychú, in the province of Entre Ríos, just 230 km from the city of Buenos Aires.
It's called the Country Carnival.
In Notes from a Private Journey, Cheryl tells us about her last visit:
... to the rhythm of drums, joy and colors, the last weekend of the "Carnival of the Country", the most important in Argentina, was held in Gualeguaychu, Entre Ríos.
It's a contagious party, which surprises with its impressive floats, sculpted bodies and endless smiles, people never stop dancing and partying.
Argentina during the years of the military dictatorship had its carnivals banned, but in cities with long tradition the carnival never ceased to be celebrated.
Gualeguaychú year after year never ceases to surprise with its carnival joy.
On January 4, the carnival of 2014 began, and on all subsequent Saturdays until the first days of March thousands of tourists will come to relive a new edition.
The blog El Vestidito Negro posts photos from 2012, such as these:

Revolution Media brings us, with a video, all that will be experienced during 2014.
Also, Gabo around the world shows us a selection of images as well as tips on how to get there and where to stay.
During the days of carnival, the city maintains other activities that bring together many people to enjoy its beaches on the Uruguay River.
Amelia McGoldrick's photography blog posts a selection of images, not only from the carnival but from her days as a tourist in the city.
However, the carnival also brings with it complaints from its neighbors about the lack of control among the attendees.
The streets were the center of entertainment and free will for about 90,000 people who took over the city.
There was literally no room for one more soul and yet more and more vehicles kept coming in.
But when we say free will, we don't just use a term that may sound harsh, but it was the feeling that many neighbors had that they preferred to almost lock themselves in their homes or, those who were a little bit luckier, move temporarily out of the tourist areas to be quieter in other parts of the city.
But the party has already started and the comrades are preparing, the drums, the dance, the glitter and the tourists are arriving to relive once again El Carnaval del País.
Hong Kong: Incredible question in primary school entrance exam
The entrance exam of a Christian primary school has gone viral on social media in Hong Kong.
Many consider the intrinsic value of the question and its answer, unacceptable.
A rich man needs ____.
A poor man has ____. If you eat ____ you die and when you die you take ____ with you.
One word is enough to fill in the four blanks.
What's that?
The answer to that question is "nothing".
The festivities of the San Sebastián Street: The carnival of Puerto Rico
It's on the San Sebastian Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The Feasts originally began as a celebration in honor of Saint Sebastian, born in Narbonne, France, and who during the third century C.E. was martyred for not renouncing his Christian faith.
In Catholic imagery, it is common to see him being pierced by several arrows and tied to a tree.
In the 1950s, the tradition of celebrating the feasts in honor of San Sebastián began as a way to raise funds for the repair of some buildings related to the church of San José in Old San Juan.
This is how the Festivals that continue to be celebrated today, this year in its 44th edition, were born.
Today, the Festivals have lost much of their religious character, becoming more of a folk festival that annually attracts more than 300,000 people.
Below I share some photos I took during my visit to the festivities.
This is Calle del Cristo, where many people used to go up to Calle San Sebastián.

Shall we start with the good news?

Here's the good news: Over the years, Global Voices has brought you countless stories of hope, courage and human creativity from around the world.
Here's the bad news: Like other news sites, we're often guilty of focusing too much on negative content and maybe that's how we end up depressing you.
Do you normally have a positive outlook on reading Global Voices, or do you feel discouraged about being exposed to what seems like an endless number of stories about injustice and human suffering?
In 2014 we plan to focus more on solution-oriented journalism.
Thus, we hope to show more light of humanity than darkness and desolation.
This does not mean that we will ignore bad things, such as violence and poverty.
However, we want to set aside a space to show the positive developments.
We've actually already started doing that, by sharing stories like good news from Yemen that you didn't know about; or the story of millions of children in Bangladesh who got free textbooks; or how Angola is using the internet to preserve native languages.
Many of our stories focus on online social movements and citizens mobilizing to improve their societies.
We want to tell these stories in a way that inspires hope; we want to avoid falling into the same format as traditional media that focuses on the negative.
To start, we have created the "Good News" category on Global Voices.
In late December, we organized a GV Face conversation between GV Co-Founder Ethan Zuckerman, Deputy Editor Sahar H. Ghazi, Advocacy Editor Ellery Biddle and a server, to discuss the topic of positive approach to stories on GV.
This will be a long-term effort that will gradually change the way we tell stories together with our authors and editors, following in the footsteps of many other news sites and organizations that are pioneering positive headlines, solution-oriented journalism, constructive reporting and other similar resources.
Even the Huffington Post already has a Good News section (though you'll probably find more cute stories about pets there than on Global Voices).
The world we want you to know through Global Voices is beautiful.
It's inhabited by brave, creative individuals who believe the planet can be a better place.
Perhaps through this change we can give our readers a sense of ways they can also contribute.
Take a look at the Good News section and share with us what you would like to see on Global Voices.
What's going on in South Sudan?
Rachel Hamada asks "What is happening in South Sudan?":
A lot of blood has been spilled all over South Sudan in the last few weeks, but not yet any ink has been spilled on Addis Ababa.
Talks are still ongoing between the middlemen and officials of the South Sudanese government, who have moved around the city, but discussions have not reached any concrete resolution, only a supposed agreement without signatures.
He also discusses why the voices of South Sudanese journalists are not being heard:
In the meantime, it is important to see WHY the voices of South Sudanese journalists are not heard outside.
Imagine you're a journalist from South Sudan.
Foreign journalists have expenses, they have transportation, they have good equipment, but local journalists often don't have access to all those resources.
Iran: Facebook administrator arrested in Iran

We're having gnocchi on the 29th!
- What?
Photo by Simenon on Flickr, licensed under Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 2.0) In Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay it is a popular tradition to eat ñoquis on the 29th of every month.
It is not known for sure where or how this custom originated, but many bloggers have dedicated their space and recipes to why and how to do it.
The blog section of Why dates back to the 8th century:
The tradition of serving gnocchi on the 29th is based on a legend dating back to the 8th century.
A young doctor named Pantaleon, who converted to Christianity and now travels as a pilgrim through northern Italy, lived in Nicosia, Asia Minor.
There he practiced miraculous healings for which he was canonized.
On one occasion when he asked for bread from some farmers, they invited him to share their poor table.
Grateful, he announces a year of fishing and abundant harvests.
The prophecy was fulfilled and many other miracles.
Saint Pantaleon was consecrated - along with Saint Mark - patron saint of Venice.
That episode occurred on the 29th, so that day is remembered with a simple meal represented by the gnocchi.
The accompanying ritual of putting money under the plate symbolizes the desire for new gifts.
Carambolatango has his favorite story:
During the war in Europe, in Italy, food was scarce then.
The government issued bonds that were exchanged for food in the expenses.
The larger families had serious difficulties in feeding themselves and making ends meet.
Solidarity between people was born and neighbors invited larger families to eat noquis, (which was always considered food for the poor).
They put a coupon under each plate and this gift allowed these groups to exchange it for food and make ends meet --
In turn, Alejandra Moglia of Chocolate and Raspberry adds another version of the story:
Another story tells that in about 1690, in a town in Piedmont, the wheat harvest was lost.
Although potatoes were only used to feed animals, they were so poor that they cooked them, mixed them with flour, and made gnocchi.
Nuria Eme of Cuaderno de recetas publishes a recipe for how to make them and adds:
The first day of the month is usually eaten on the 29th of every month, and apparently the origin (of this version, because there are several) is that, being one of the last days of the month, people who had few resources and were paid on the first of the month, had to find ways to eat with food made with cheap raw materials.
And of course, we already know that potatoes and flour, they're not overly expensive.
And although the tradition is ancient, I believe that unfortunately, it is extrapolated in time, and totally current with the circumstances that we have had to live.
But also tradition went beyond meals.
In Argentina, public employees and those who are not working but are going to get their paycheck on the 29th of each month are nicknamed "ñoquis".
Legend or tradition, in the Southern Cone it is a custom that is still alive, and if you still do not know how to make them we leave you another recipe: Recipe of homemade Ñoquis.
Berlin and Tokyo celebrate 20 years of friendship as sister cities, and representatives of creative industries, including Marc Wohlrabe, chairman of the Berlin Club Commission, and Takahiro Saito, lawyer and member of Let's Dance, a consortium that fights Japan's dance regulations, will meet after the AFTER 25 conference on March 1, 2014 in Tokyo to discuss how creative culture can contribute to the socioeconomic development of both cities:
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, extreme social, cultural, and economic changes transformed the city into a unique playground.
Today, 25 years later, it attracts creative people, technology companies, social entrepreneurs and investors from all over the world.
Berlin recognized its creative subcultures as part of its identity and history, which now act as key drivers for tourism and the economy.
This transformed Berlin into a unique, successful city, demonstrating how support for creativity can grow into key economic and social drivers of innovation and growth.
This dramatic and positive change that Berlin has gone through leads us to the question: what role can Tokyo's creative culture play in laying the foundation for the next phase of the city?

El Salvador and Costa Rica will have second round elections
El Salvador and Costa Rica held presidential elections on Sunday, February 2, but both countries will define their president in a second round of elections.
In El Salvador, the "results show that Salvador Sánchez Ceren (FMLN) got 49%, just under the 50% he needed to win in the first round.
Norman Quijano (ARENA) is second with 39%", writes Boz of Bloggings by boz, where he posts "Five points in the elections of El Salvador".
Meanwhile in Costa Rica, The Tico Times reports:
The center-left presidential candidate Luis Guillermo Solís will contest with the ruling party's candidate, Johnny Araya, in a second round on April 6, after Solís stunned many in this small Central American country by coming in first in the preliminary results released on Sunday night.
The peaceful elections in Costa Rica showed a growing polarization between progressive and conservative voters.
Mental health of Aymara children
The website Indigenous News analyzes a study conducted by BMC Psychiatry on 748 children aged 9 to 15 from nine different schools attended by students from low socioeconomic sectors in the city of Arica, in northern Chile.
Aymara families are traditionally developed, where the elders advise the young and it is customary for the mother to take care of household chores and be responsible for the education of the children, while the father is the one who makes the decisions and provides the economic support of the family.
Greater involvement with Aymara culture may be a protective factor against anxiety and depression symptoms in Aymara children.
This points to an additional benefit to the preservation of cultural traditions within this population.

After a grenade explosion killed three children at an anti-government protest in Bangkok, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) urged the government and protest leaders to protect children and keep them away from them.
Bijaya Rajbhandari, UNICEF representative in Thailand made this appeal:
(UNICEF) condemns the violence that results in these tragic and senseless accidents and deaths of children.
These incidents highlight the urgent need to keep children out of harm's way in order to ensure their safety.
UNICEF urges the Government, the leaders of the demonstrations whether pro-government or anti-government and all parents to ensure that their children do not enter the protest sites and keep them away from all areas where they are taking place.
In Cuba, as everywhere, everything increases except wages.
Food prices have risen in recent times in Cuba, while the salaries of state workers remain the same. (Photo courtesy of author)
The recently concluded congress of the Central of Workers of Cuba, the only organization of its kind in the country, concluded with the confirmation that there will be no increase in wages for state workers in Cuba until productivity increases.
In this country, the average salary of state workers is 15 dollars a month (according to the exchange rate of the official Cuban currency) and the cost of living has increased in recent years, following the implementation of economic measures such as the removal of some food from the basic basket subsidized by the State.
This is compounded by the marked rise in food prices on the non-state market.
According to Cuban President Raul Castro,
It would be irresponsible and counterproductive to have a general increase in wages in the public sector, since it would only cause a spiral of inflation in prices if not properly backed up by a sufficient increase in the supply of goods and services.
The conditioning of wage increases to productivity increases brings the debate on the issue back to the vicious circle in which it has been in recent times.
In this regard, the newly elected secretary of the organization, Ulises Guilarte, pointed out that in many places this is pointed out as:
... cause discouragement, apathy and disinterest in work, with consequent impacts on labour discipline, the exodus of skilled workers to better paid but less demanding occupations, undoubtedly leading to a process of decapitalisation of the workforce, which has had a fundamental impact on the basic industrial branches, the Ministry of Construction and others, in addition to the increasingly frequent refusal to be promoted to managerial responsibilities.
In his speech, Raúl Castro confirmed that medical services will receive a salary increase, "because the country's fundamental income at this time is due to the work of thousands of doctors providing services abroad".
In January 2011, the Brazilian ambassador in Havana announced that this year there will be 11,000 Cuban doctors in his country working in the poorest and hardest-to-reach areas.
This South-South cooperation is endorsed by the Pan American Health Organization and will provide about $500 million dollars annually to Cuba.
From his blog, Corners of Cuba, Alejandro Ulloa says:
If there are not abundant foreign investments, as well as the recapitalization of important productive sectors, the Cuban economy will be moving in this vicious circle, which is clearly aimed at increasing the purchasing power of wages, a real problem affecting the population today.
Protests against TV show in Iran
Sarzamine Kohan
Protests against the TV series called Sarzamine Kohan (Ancient Land) broke out in mid-February in several cities in Iran, including Dezful and Ahvaz in the oil-rich province of Khuzestan.
The protesters say the program insulted the Bahtari ethnic group and the role the leaders played in Iran's Constitutional Revolution.
In at least one dialogue of the fictional show, it was said that the Bakhtyaris are "in the service of the English", which means they were traitors.
Sixty members of parliament wrote a letter of repudiation to Iranian state television complaining about this representation.
The Bajtiari ethnic group, living mainly in Chahar Mahal, Bajtiari and certain areas of Khuzestan, Lorestan and Isfahan Province, played an important role in the history of Iran.
Protests in Dezful
Freedom Messenger shared several footage of a demonstration in Dezful, which took place on Friday 14.
Several netizens tweeted about the controversial series.
Tevis tweeted:
Today, they destroyed bajtiari, tomorrow they will do it with other ethnic groups.
The_Sina tweeted:
Here are the photos of the demonstration in Masjed Soleiman that took place on Friday, February 15.
If you protest, do it in a good way, without violence.
Iran's third channel (which broadcasts the controversial series) played bajtiari music several times today.
Probably to soften the current atmosphere.
I type then I exist: messages in local languages
A few days ago I was chatting with a good friend of mine on the BlackBerry messaging platform.
We were talking about specialized topics, and we were doing it in Nigerian Pidgin.
I'm not Nigerian, but living with a large community of Nigerians is learning.
As we talked, I was frustrated because my phone's self-correction function insisted on  correcting  the interjection  na  to  N'a , or completing the expression  sha  as  shame .
So I impulsively opened the language settings, and when she asked me to choose a language, I laughed out loud, because I realized the absurdity: Pidgin is not on the list of languages on any modern electronic platform.
Screenshot of  Yoruba Keyboard , an application that replaces the keyboard to be able to type in Yoruba, a language available on Windows Phone OS.

So I started thinking and I asked myself, why?
According to user data from the Nigerian Communications Commission, Nigeria has about 122 million connected and active telephone lines, of which, 97% are mobile lines, making the country the first in this category in Africa and the ninth in the world.
Still, the most widely spoken language in Nigeria is not available in phone settings.
However, this problem is not unique to Nigeria.
Worldwide, dialects and lingua franca less widely spoken than official languages are underrepresented in the technological world.
For example, Urdu is the national and official language of Pakistan, and is the official language in five Indian states.
At the same time, in Africa, several dialects of the Bantu family, of similar predominance, are not present on mobile devices.
There are apps and plugins developed by third parties to help native speakers feel more comfortable with their smartphones.
Among these projects, Kannada-Hindi Keyboard allows its users to type from messages to notes in Kannada and Devanagari (Marathi/Hindi) writing from India, and Multiling Keyboard is an Android keyboard app that accepts around 130 languages.
But app developers often suffer from a lack of funding and lack of consumer support, which often leads to abandonment.
Or does the world think that these languages have no place in the high-tech sector?
Hopefully in the coming years we will have Android or iOS platforms that allow customizing the root of the user interface, including keyboard and data entry settings in Pashto and Igbo languages.
Flipboard adds Global Voices to local content guides

Chile: 'March of all marches' takes Santiago
March of all marches, Santiago of Chile.
Image provided by @SorayaSM
With the slogan The march of all causes united , more than 40 civil organizations (except students) called this Saturday 22 to the 'March of all marches' that gathered more than a hundred thousand people in Santiago to demand a new constitution via a constituent assembly.
This event was called from the need to unite civil society, to make the request to the government of Michelle Bachelet to change the current Political Constitution of Chile, which was promulgated during the military dictatorship of Pinochet.
March of all marches, Santiago of Chile.

Another of the demands is a universal bill of rights.
In this regard, David Ordenes, coordinator of Movimiento Movilizándonos, told Global Voices that they are demanding a universal law of rights focused on children and youth: "so that this society from now on complies with children, because they are democracy and social actors... and therefore the march of all the marches is about being attentive and making proposals".
The massive protest went on peacefully until the end of the march, where clashes with Carabineros developed.

PHOTOS: Birdwatching in the Southern Philippines
Lalage nigra. What is it?
This is a picture of Arnold Alamon.
There are over 600 species of birds on the 7,000 islands that make up the Philippines, which means that there are plenty of opportunities to observe the elegant beauty of these flying creatures.
Unfortunately, bird habitats are threatened by aggressive building projects and rapid destruction of the natural environment.
In recent years, birdwatching has become more than just an organized and fun activity for hobbyists and scientists across the country.
One of the festival organizers, maiabird, wrote something about the strange bird species in Zamboanga:
So I got three shots in four hours of observation in Pasonanca.
The Pasonanca Nature Park is a wonderful place to go birdwatching.
The place itself is amazing, and so is the life of the birds (and even tracking them is easy!).
We'll definitely be back and spending more time discovering more of the forest.
Of course, we automatically dumped the contents of our garbage bags in the vicinity of the burrowing fireflies' nests, and that made the pond an important place for birds.
It's dawn on a school pond in Zamboanga.

Angela, one of the delegates of the bird festival, shared a video on Facebook of a spilornis holospilus she saw in a feeding basin in Zamboanga.
Meanwhile, university professor Arnold Alamon has been posting pictures of birds in Gitagum, also on Mindanao Island.
Below are some pictures of birds from Arnold's Facebook page:
It's called Cinnyris jugularis.

The joke is in the media: Day of the Innocent in Ethiopia
Ethiopians celebrate the day of the innocent on Twitter with fake news headlines that mimic the lies of the state media.
An Ethiopian tweeter says: "They broadcast deception 365 days a year, and we are returning to them, as much as we can, dozens of fake headlines".

A strong seismic movement of approximately 8.3 degrees of magnitude was felt in Northern Chile and Southern Peru, as well as in the surrounding areas of Bolivia, at 6.46 on Tuesday, April 1, Peruvian time, and 8.46 Chilean time, causing tsunami alerts and alarms to be issued in both Chile and Peru.
Peruvians used Twitter during and after the earthquake.
There, it became known that due to the fall of some electrical poles, the city of Tacna is without electricity: In the city of #Tacna the movement was felt strong, the city is without electricity #AlertaNoticias  Danitza Lawless (@danitza_pf) April 2, 2014

Wikitongues: document your language
Screenshot from wikitongues.org (11-03-14)
Wikitongues is a new project that hopes to document the 7,000 languages on the planet.
Currently, Wikitongues is building a platform where anyone can upload their own videos, making it a collaborative project as well as a non-profit initiative.
The developers hope to have doubled the number of videos currently (50) by the end of the year.
Volunteers called ambassadors help to build this database to make it easier to access information, and they are located in Switzerland, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Norway, Russia and Spain.
According to co-founder Daniel Bogre Udell, by documenting many different people from different regions speaking the same language, they hope to get a cultural application of the language.
Here is an example in English, with a speaker from North Carolina, USA, and another from South Africa:
Here is a section for polyglots, people who speak more than one language: The videos include what are commonly known as "minority languages", such as Quiché, a Maya derivative, which originated in Guatemala.
However, the Wikitongues team is cautious about referring to different languages as majority or minority on the website, and they give everyone equality regardless of the total number of speakers in the world.
Wikitongues also chooses a "Language of the Week" to discuss on its Tumblr blog, and includes links and information about each language.
Until recently, they were focused on the Basque language.
You can follow the project on Instagram and Twitter, and connect to share your own videos.
