April 23 is UNESCO's International Book Day  and just because the Global Voices team loves blogs, it doesn't mean we've forgotten other forms of the written word!
Moreover, because we believe that reading literature is a very enjoyable way to learn about another culture, we have a fun challenge for all Global Voices contributors and readers, and bloggers everywhere.
The Global Voices Book Challenge is as follows:
1) Read a book in the next month from a country whose literature you have never read before.
2) Write a blog post about him during the week of April 23.
If you would like to know what you should read about Vietnam, Bolivia, Mozambique or New Zealand, or any other country, simply ask in the comments section below!
I'm sure someone will give you some suggestions.
And if you have any recommendations about any work in your own country that should be read, please leave a comment too.
Once you've read your book (and written a post!) let us know  we'd love to find out what you've learned on your literary expedition.
Feel free to use the images above and below to spread the Global Voices Book Challenge!
China: Marching to protect the Eastern Lake in Wuhan
The Eastern Lake, located in the city of Wuhan, is a tourist and ecological area, covering an area of 82 square kilometers and six times larger than the Western Lake.
As it is a national tourist area 4A its planning should be subject to environmental assessment and public consultation.
However, in May 2009 a real estate developer, Overseas Chinese Town, OCT (ing) signed an agreement on the development of this lake with the Wuhan city government, without mediating public consultation.
In December 2009, the real estate developer OCT obtained the contract for the development of a large area of land (3167 m2, 1 m2 = 666,67 m2) occupying 1000 m of the lake surface. (precedents via donghu)
The photo shows the natural beauty of the Eastern Lake:
In March 2010, the local media presented the construction plan and in April of the same year the OCT claimed that the development project does not affect the East Lake.
However, blogger Yaohaiying pointed out (chi) that the so-called artificial fish pond (450 m) is located in the central part of the picturesque area and is clearly defined in the article on the protection of the Eastern Lake approved by the Minister of State.
Douban posted the adviser's note (chi):
Japan: People live longer, the same goes for TV shows
Japan may be known for the longevity of its people, but television shows have a rich and long history as its population.
There are some series that have been on the air for over half a century.
What's interesting is the variety of them, from talk shows, news and sports to cooking shows, music, anime and even a show about the Imperial Family.
This article takes a look at the Japanese Choju Bangumi (長寿番組), which literally means long life program . The definitions for Choju programs range from those who are 10 years old to those who are 50.
Oricon, which published a popularity ranking based on a survey, defines Choju shows as shows that have been on the air for more than 10 years.
A survey of over 30 years of Saitama Prefecture describes it as  one of the few programs with old music'.
As another Nagano Prefecture survey responded, almost the same age:  the tension that is unique to live broadcasting and the events are great.
Fuji TV's Sazaesan , considered an iconic anime show, came in second.
The fourth one was for Nippon TV's Shoten.
The first anime Sazaesan  was broadcast on October 5, 1969.
It's a show that's been on the air for a long time and it's turned 41 this year.
At a time when 20% of the ratings of Startime dramas have become scarce, Sazaesan  gets a solid 20% average.
This is extremely high for an anime show and has cemented the show as a national icon.
Probably, the characters are recognized by 100% of the public.
It would be NBC's Meet the Press , the Sunday morning political program that began in 1947.
Next up is CBS Evening News  and the NBC morning news program  Today .
The fourth is the CBS daytime drama Guiding Light.
What stands out from the list of Japanese Choju programs is the predominance of NHK (Japan Broadcasting Association), especially if you look at programs with more than half a century of history.
A wide range of genres are represented here, including the singing contest Nodojiman  (which can be said to resemble American Idol) and Kohaku Uta Gassen (an annual music program), and limited to news programs such as the US list.
PBS, which could be considered the U.S. equivalent of a public broadcaster that was a pioneer in the industry in its respective countries, barely makes the top 10.
After watching an episode of Sazae-san, blogger Zakiyama Yumeko explained his argument and reflected: "I wonder if the atmosphere of feeling good  is the secret of the Choju programs?
Do you like watching programs that your parents and grandparents also liked or are they outdated and boring?
Latin America: Free Software Installation Festival 2010
Across Latin America, free software is important for many countries and people who have decided to use these resources in public administration, as well as to find solutions to other challenges.
For example, in Cuba, the free software movement helped with sustainable development.The Ecuadorian government proposed public policies that included the use of free software, as did another regional leader in free software and culture, Brazil.
On April 24, 2010, many free software developers and users in Latin America celebrated with a party called FLISOL2010.

Watching the World Cup together: Uruguay vs France
The World Cup, which is arguably the largest sporting event in the world, is being held for the first time on the African continent.
Global Voices has highlighted the multiple voices of citizens speaking about the event and its social impact around the world.
In an effort to expand this conversation, we thought we could try having a real-time chat while the games are going on.
We will begin with the Uruguay-Fancia meeting, which will take place on the opening day of the tournament, 11 June at 20:30 in South Africa.
You can click on the FIFA match list to see your local time.
France and Uruguay have been known rivals since Uruguay helped eliminate then-reigning champion France at the 2002 World Cup.
We invite you to join us in the broadcast and discussion of this event where we will be live a few minutes before the game starts (20:30 local time).
We will have participants from Uruguay and France, as well as many African nations, including South Africa.
Different Global Voices bloggers and translators will watch the tournament live.
The conversation will also be enabled on Global Voices in French.

South Africa: discussion on vuvuzulas at the World Cup
Perhaps the current look of the 2010 World Cup has been the bright new stadiums or the colorful costumes worn by the fans of each of the 32 nations competing.
But undoubtedly, the sound that defines the tournament has been the deaf vowel, which can be heard by spectators attending the games or by viewers.
The remarkable sound has sparked a debate about whether the vuvuzela adds or removes experience to the World Cup.
However, for international visitors and spectators, the sound of the plastic instrument has been a novelty.
Photo of the vuvuzela in Soccer City by Alvez and used under a Creative Commons license.
This debate dates back to the 2009 Confederations Cup held in South Africa, which may have been the first contact with sound for many fans of world football.
Some called for the vuvuzela to be banned in the stadium, saying it took away the game's enjoyment.
He said, "We shouldn't try to Europeanize the African World Cup".
Now, with a few days in the tournament, it has become an internet topic for those who complain about it, as well as those who defend the instrument and even those who criticize complaints about the vuvuzela.
Although there are some reports that FIFA may consider restricting vuvuzela due to television complaints, many believe it will move forward.
The criticism of the vuvuzela's buzzing proved to be rather funny for some, who turned it around to lighten their complaints.
Daniel Reeders (@onekind) said: The West discovers Africa, discovers it is noisy, discordant, overwhelming and retires to Twitter to complain about #vuvuzela
Finally, Karabo Harry (@kayrabH) puts it all in perspective, offering a suggestion:
If the sound of the #Vuvuzela annoys you, look for #EarPlugs and complain about important things like #Analphabetism and #Poverty
Bolivia: The cost of Internet domains
Compared to many of its regional neighbors, where Chileans can purchase a .cl domain for US$40 for 2 years and where Argentines can even purchase a "com.ar" domain for free, the price in Bolivia is out of reach for many local residents.
Recently, the Information Center of Bolivia's Networks (NIC) announced that they have reduced the price for the acquisition of a ".bo" domain name by 35%.

Several human rights organizations and individual advocates from different sectors are behind this website where they work together to offer victims of torture psychological and legal advice, exposing more incidents, reaching out to traditional media organizations and raising public awareness about the cases and their repercussions.
The Ministry of Interior has decided to settle accounts with those who have exposed their torture scandals.

Niger: Silent famine
The food crisis in the Sahel, which is hardly being reported, is reaching worrying proportions as about 2.5 million people in Niger are currently affected by food shortages.
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has decided to increase emergency operations to protect the population at risk.Following the 2005 food crisis, bloggers in Niger are reflecting on a new crisis, which this year is the result of the shortage of rain last year.

Bolivian voices: Jaqi Aru, spreading Aymara on the internet
Aymara is a native American language and one of the official languages of Peru and Bolivia.
There are about two million speakers of Aymara in Bolivia and almost three million in total in South America.
Ruben Hilari, with some local volunteers from El Alto, Bolivia, established the virtual community Jaqi Aru.
The aim of the Jaqi Aru website is to highlight and disseminate the Aymara language on the internet, through the creation of content in digital media, which consists of translation, multimedia use and social media tools.
Aymara has been losing speakers, both due to the use of Spanish and Quechua in the past century and many of the speakers of Aymara now speak Quechua, another native South American language.

Argentina: Former president Néstor Kirchner dies
This Wednesday, in the early hours of the morning, Nestor Kirchner, former president and husband of the current president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, passed away.
The death, due to a heart attack, occurred in the Patagonian town of Calafate, where he resided for the last few years.
Kirchner's sudden death prompted many people to gather in the city center during the day, even though it was a census-making holiday.
His remains are expected to be veiled Thursday at the Casa Rosada, the traditional workplace of presidents.

The call for participation opens
And you, yes, YOU, are part of this change.
In fact, as digital natives -- someone for whom digital technologies are fundamental to life, you are directly affecting the lives of many, sometimes even without knowing it.
The Center for Internet and Society and Wires in partnership with Rising Voices is inviting young technology users from Latin America and the Caribbean to join a global conversation.
The 3-day workshop, titled "From Face to Interface", will focus on how young people use new platforms, media and communication and expression spaces in the digital age.
Whether you've used digital technologies to make your voice heard, to express your opinion creatively online or to create new knowledge, we want to hear from you.
We invite you to share your perspectives in an informal conversation with like-minded people from neighboring communities.
The workshop is open to candidates from Latin America and the Caribbean, who are interested in an interactive and engaging dialogue that marks the beginning of the "Digital Natives with a Cause?" research in the region.
"From Face to Interface" is part of a more international research project, with the aim of producing a book in English, consolidating the knowledge of the Digital Natives of the Southern Hemisphere.
The workshop also aims to build a Knowledge Network in collaboration with the other participants and partners of the previous workshops in Taipei and Johannesburg.
This workshop will include organisers residing in India and the Netherlands and participants who will also come from countries where Spanish is not the main language.
Therefore, good knowledge of English is necessary.
The communication during the workshop will be in English, with Spanish translations available at certain times of the activity.

At just fifteen, Candy is probably the youngest member of the Global Voices team.
Her participation in Global Voices has not only benefited her language skills, but also helped her promote her native language, Malagasy.
Currently, Candy is a high school student, wants to learn more about infographics once she leaves school and hopes to use her blog as a means for social change.

Egypt: January 25 protests in photos
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Egyptian protests.
One image is worth a thousand tweets, especially when Twitter is blocked in Egypt in order to stop the flow of information about the ongoing protests in Egypt today (25).
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia decided to take her camera and take to the streets to take some photos and upload them to her Flickr account.
Here are some of his photographs: In Cairo, tens of thousands of members of the security forces were seen on the streets early, wearing their famous black uniforms.
Photo taken by Zeinobia, under creative commons license.
The streets were empty.
Still, the security forces had their own plans to control the crowd of protesters, especially when the usual traffic congestion was not there to naturally control the protesters.
Security forces blocked some of the main blocks and intersections in Cairo.
Cars were redirected to bridges or tunnels as much as possible, since it's harder to manifest in a tunnel, right!?
Some Twitter users reported that the underground was closed to control the mass of protesters.

Rassd New Network posted a shocking photo of protesters in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo on its Facebook page.
In the afternoon, the number of protesters in El-Tahrir Square became really large.
Midan El-Tahrir or El-Tahrir Square (El-Tahrir Square) has been the site of numerous large protests and demonstrations, including the March 2003 one when people went out to protest the Iraq War.
The blockade was reported on Twitter during the afternoon.Before that, some people were able to upload photos to services like twitterpic. @M_Na7as uploaded the photo below his account on twitterpic, showing how the protesters outnumbered the security forces in the city of El-Mahalla.

Egypt: A voice in the blackout, thanks to Google and Twitter
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Egyptian protests.
Last night, following the total internet shutdown in Egypt, Google and Twitter (along with SayNow, a company recently acquired by Google) made a timely announcement: together they launched SpeakToTweet, a service that would allow Egyptians to call an international number and record a voice message that would then be tweeted from the @speak2tweet account.
All night, the Twitter account showed footage of Egyptians who learned about the service.
Due to the total ban on the internet, Egyptians probably learned about it through calls from their friends and family outside the country.
@monasosh is one of these users; his brother @alaa reported that he had taken advantage of the service.
So, I wanted everyone to know in case they didn't get any information about what's happening tomorrow, and I didn't want them to worry about us.
This time, I'm not afraid, like I want to say, 'Try it!
Stay with us!
Most calls are made anonymously, without the speaker identifying.
Another call from Egypt, available here, says the following:
Tomorrow, it will be history.
Tomorrow, we'll make history with it.
Tomorrow, the Mubarak regime will be over.
Tomorrow, we want you out of our country.
Long live Egypt.
Egyptians outside the country have also taken advantage of the service to make their message heard around the world.
Stay strong, Egyptians, stay strong, we love you.
This is an Egyptian-American speaking for all the Egyptian-Americans who emigrated here because of the brutal regime, stay strong: they are making us very proud.
I love you!
Anyone can use the service by calling one of the following international numbers and leaving a voice message: +16504194196 or +390662207294 or +97316199855.
The message will be automatically tweeted on @Speak2Tweet.
Brazil: Ministry of Culture abandons Creative Commons
On January 9, Global Voices shared the concern of many Brazilian citizens who wrote an open letter to President-elect Dilma Rousseff and new Minister of Culture Ana de Hollanda.
The letter urged the Minister to uphold the previous government's policy on inclusive public policies regarding the internet, digital culture and copyright.
Two weeks later, on January 20, the Brazilian Ministry of Culture removed a Creative Commons license from its website.
The order to remove it was apparently given by the Dutch Minister and provoked all kinds of reactions on social media as well as among bloggers.

The only thing these two sides ironically have in common is their president, Hugo Chávez, who on February 2, 2011 celebrated 12 years in power.
This appreciation is tangibly demonstrated in every street in the country on the walls of its cities.
At the same time, in social media the world has seen the clashes in what we call society 2.0: Venezuelans have taken Twitter as their platform to discuss the situation and what are on the one hand the mistakes of the 12 years of government, and on the other hand the achievements of the revolution -2 ways of thinking about a divided country.

Sudan: South Sudan becomes the newest African country
Officially, South Sudan has become the newest country in Africa, after South Sudanese voted to secede from the North.
Official referendum figures released on Monday 7 showed that 98.83% of southern voters chose to separate from the north.

Pascal Ladu publishes a podcast that captures the historic moment when the South Sudan Referendum Commission declared the preliminary official results of the referendum in Juba:
A large crowd of South Sudanese gathered at Dr. John Garang's Mausoleum in Juba to celebrate the announcement of the preliminary official results of the referendum on Sunday.
The results showed almost unanimous support for separation across South Sudan.
The colorful occasion was celebrated with songs, dancing, horn sounds and drumming.
The results, announced by the President of the South Sudan Referendum Commission and its Vice-President, were met with a loud applause from the crowd.
As'ad questions the double morals of the United States:
Compare the speed with which the US government recognized the state of South Sudan and the US government's treatment of Palestine.
Law Hawk says South Sudan will need to trust its northern neighbor:
Still, Sudan will need to trust its northern neighbor as the main oil pipeline from the southern oil fields must travel through Sudan to generate much of the revenue needed to get the country going.
How will South Sudan attract investors?:
Mature is rare...
Whatever the word, it should refer to benchmarks... not actions...!
Without any benchmarks, any action can be called wonderful...!! as long as it's not compared...!!
I don't intend to question any official or representative, but Bell's syndrome tells us that only 2% (at any level) can view the full picture...
It takes learning all the lessons to pave your way without bright, false or distorted interests...
If you trusted a knowledge-based "darfur" expert...
This is not a recipe for IFD or point-to-point protocol (PPP), only for UN/Government Assistant... Until it draws its own realistic views on government (which Singapore did), job creation (e.g. the Balkans), governance (e.g. South Africa); it is unlikely that South Sudan will attract investors...!
They're ambitious and cautious...
Kizzie is very jealous of the South Sudanese:
A good friend of mine said that the northerners are upset about the South Sudan referendum because the southerners had the opportunity to vote and every southern vote makes a difference, we have nothing.
I registered to vote in the April election, but my chosen candidate withdrew from the run-off and I was left wondering if my vote would have made any difference to begin with.
Sudanese Optimist is happy for South Sudan, but...
Although I am very happy that South Sudan finally gained its independence from the condescending enemies in the north, I am truly sad to see that we have lost such a vibrant part of our Sudanese culture.
Perhaps seeing all this political craziness here lately, what amazes me the most is the St. Francis Prayer I read yesterday during the announcement of separation.
Lodiong Morris reports that the North and South have resolved the issue of citizenship status:
According to the Minister, the semi-autonomous Government of South Sudan (GoSS) and the National Government agreed that Southerners who want to stay in the north can become citizens of the north if they so wish.
Argentina: 26 years since the death of Julio Cortázar
Yesterday, February 12, 2011, 26 years have passed since the Argentine writer Julio Cortázar died of leukemia.
Simon Kofoed writes about the author's life in argen-times.
Where did the 15,000 people registered here go?
They probably went to finish their shopping and hurry home.
In the end, they came to a text called the "Cancun Agreement", which has the advantage of receiving the approval of the majority of delegates (better than the previous episode in Copenhagen).
...the extremely positive nature of all the press releases I've read since yesterday.
For most of our English-speaking colleagues and those of the Climate Action Network (whose mechanism I am now dominating), most of the communiqués were prepared well before the COP ended.
...whatever the final agreement of Cancun, the President ended his speech with a phrase: "We understand that we are not following our internal norms, but to save the face in Cancun, we are adopting the text".
Egypt: Kareem Amer is free
This post is part of our special coverage of the Egyptian protests in 2011.
The prominent Egyptian blogger Kareem Amer, also known as Abdulkareem Nabeel Sulaiman, was released, according to Twitter users.
Kareem, who was meeting independent filmmaker Samir Eshra, was 'kidnapped' by a group of thugs after leaving Tahrir Square on February 7. They were then handed over to military security for violating the curfew imposed in Egypt since the January 25 protests began.
Kareem, who had spent four years in prison for an article he posted on his blog, was released on November 15.
@daliaziada: Good news: Blogger Kareem Amer has been released.
@weddady: I just got news that Kareem Amer was released. #Jan25

Gaddafi: Death to all for everything
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Libyan Uprising.
Libya's dictator, Muammar Al Gaddafi, made a speech on state television on Tuesday, in which he showed his anger and warned and threatened anti-government protesters and all those who support them, telling them that Libya will end up in the same situation as countries like Afghanistan, Iraq or Somalia.
In his speech, he called on Libyan citizens to take to the streets tomorrow and go after the terrorists and hand them over to the security forces, so they can be punished with death.
He also said he will continue to fight for Libya until his last drop of blood falls and listed, with all kinds of details, every one of the actions that will be punished with the death penalty, such as working for international organizations, using violence against government forces or threatening the country's security.
This nonsensical and apparently improvised speech was followed by Libyan and Arab citizens as well as citizens from around the world on Twitter.
With it, Gadaffi has aroused both sarcasm and ridicule, despite the instability the country is experiencing and the tragic circumstances in which the deaths have occurred.
Gaddafi justified the brutal offensive of the last few days against protesters, and also spoke of other events that happened in the past, when some governments had to kill protesters, and said things like Unity in China was more important than the lives of those in Tianamen Square .
He also said that tomorrow, young people (those who are not under the influence of drugs) should form groups to defend the revolution he has initiated.
While waiting for him to deliver his speech, some Twitter users commented ironically on why it took so long to deliver his announced speech.
@acarvin: Gaddafi: they have taken young people away from their families and given them hallucinogens.
Those who have supplied them deserve punishment.
@rania_hafez: Gaddafi: Those who confront the Libyan authorities and raise their weapons against citizens of our country will be punished with the death penalty according to Libyan law
@draddee: Gaddafi calls for social committees to be formed to protect the values, ethics and morals of #Libya society
@habibh: #Gaddafi threatens his own people on television with death penalty ...
@kimo79: The best thing #gaddafi is doing with this bullshit speech is to give even more strength to the revolution in #libia.

This is a criminal act.
Anyone who lifts a weapon will be punished with the death penalty.

@avinunu: Gaddafi: All people in towns and cities who want Muammar Gaddafi must take to the streets
@acarvin: Gaddafi, raising his arms: those who carried weapons, have given armored cars to young people.
@acarvin: Gaddafi: you are responsible for the committees.
I ask the Libyan people to create new municipalities, as my son mentioned.
@nour_odeh: #Gaddafi: The world is laughing at you (rebels).
People have to create new municipalities, committees.
@ChangeInLibya: he's insulting people who are supporting him , in the green square...they're also showing pictures of the green square from 20 days ago:)
@acarvin: Gaddafi: The power struggle has been resolved.
@acarvin: Gaddafi: that's what the people of Libya want.
@nour_odeh: #Gaddafi: We gave power to the people in 1977.
We are not in a position to do anything and we have no authority, we are just fighting for Libya, we are defending it #Libya
@Dima_Khatib: Gaddafi: Some young people have tried to do the same thing that people have done in Tunisia and Egypt #libia #feb17
@avinunu: Gaddafi denies he has power, says he gave everything to the people of Libya in 1977.
@draddee: Gaddafi: We are the ones who fought the US and the UK on our land and the ones who would die unless they finish us off.
@acarvin: Gaddafi: At the hospital, no one dared change the name.
Who dared to do such things?
@avinunu: Gaddafi also said that all those who died were police.
@TravellerW: Don't dictators ever get tired of blaming foreigners? #libya #gaddafi
@JNovak_Yemen: #the Libyan lunatic asks people to take to the streets to fight the protesters, doing the same as #AliSeh did with his #Yemen supporters

@evanchill: Libyan state television finally finds citizens in favour of Gadaffi, but shows us pictures of unknown when and taken unknown where.

@lisang: I think these dictators are using the same script.
Foreign media is the worst, the influence of other countries is bad, I would shed my blood for this country
@tomgara: Look, Americans, Reagan already left this building weakened after that bombing.
It wouldn't have to be very expensive to finish the job.
It would be the best live broadcast in history.
@algergawi: Gaddafi They should transcribe the Arabic speech into Arabic equally.
@Mustafa_Qadri: It's not true, Michael Jackson stole my colonel uniform , says Gaddafi.
@bongkersz: I wonder if Hitler will get angry again on YouTube because #Gaddafi is crazier than he is.
@TravellerW: In their speeches, dictators often mention that children and youth are not getting the right information, thus discrediting their opponents. #libya
@AfriNomad: Do you count this as speech #2 or #3?
And what's with the rats and the hallucinogens? #Libya #Feb17
@warrenellis: Gaddafi's speech is reduced to "Everyone is drugged except me".

"We Are Not Ants": A book that promotes informed optimism
"Where ignorance is happiness, it is madness to be wise", wrote Thomas Gray in 1742.
In the age of social media and digital media, sometimes it seems that there is only bad news and there is nothing the average citizen can do about it.
Most people know the old saying that ignorance is happiness, but is it possible that it is exactly the opposite, that ignorance generates unhappiness?
The book We Are Not Ants came about in response to a widespread negativity and sense of powerlessness.
But it is not a simple self-help book, massive and carefree.
The four young Spanish authors, who combine knowledge of economics, journalism, international development, entrepreneurship, marketing and design, presented the project as a
If we were ants, humans would be a happy species.
We have colonized the entire planet, our life expectancy is increasing and our technological achievements are impressive.
However, we realize the magnitude of the challenges we face and the dangers and injustices that still lurk before us.
We are a community and what we do we do together, we share a common origin and, alongside planet Earth, we also share a common future.
A future that we decide.
The book is divided into three chapters:
Chapter 1
The world is fine.
Humans have made incredible progress in many areas over the past few decades: we live longer, we are able to feed more, we are able to educate more, we have eradicated many diseases that were once deadly, and we are more supportive.
Chapter 3
Many will say that this is not enough and that humans have not been able to solve the major social challenges.
But we're doing better than we think and than the pessimists want us to believe.
Chapter 3
What can you do to make it better?
Stop complaining!
The world is full of social innovators, people who create ideas and tools that allow us all to live better, more sustainable and with more opportunities for all without having to give up on progress.
If you want to know them and know what you can do to live up to your ideals, you'll find a selection of 120 in the book and more on that website.
We are not ants includes Global Voices in its selection of innovative platforms.
Through innovative use of infographics and a combination of traditional and digital media, We Are Not Ants provides a balanced and critical view of the state of the planet, and offers concrete alternatives to change.
The book can be previewed on the website and purchased on paper or in digital edition.

Serbia: Reactions to news of Serbian mercenaries in Libya
The Serbian daily 'Alo' with a picture of Serbian mercenaries in Libya.
According to the Maltese blog Malta CC, Serbian military pilots are presumed to have taken part in the bombings of protesters in the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi.
This came to light after two Libyan pilots fled to Malta, refusing to bomb their fellow citizens who are participating in the uprising in Libya.
In the same article, Alo revealed that allegedly Serbian mercenaries were killing protesters on the streets of Tripoli and Benghazi:
Serbian mercenaries earn tens of thousands of dollars for this work... They come from Serbia, but Bosnian and Croatian agencies are involved in recruiting them for this kind of work... The "Serbian legionnaires" are veterans of conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. In addition to former members of military and police units, the bulk of these forces are the former... Gaddafi pays them as much as they ask! A good number of them had highly paid jobs in various African countries, but this was not an offer to refuse.
It can be expected that in the near future many of our contractors will go with Gaddafi, who has great confidence in Serbian soldiers.
It seems that Serbian internet users are not too surprised by these accusations and revelations.
The Krstarica Forum is one of the richest debating venues.
It's not surprising, people.
The professionals are doing everything for money...
No emotion, no morality, and no reason to be...
In the wars in the former Yugoslavia, they cooperated with Croats, Muslims, why would they not now work for Gaddafi.
They don't care who's boss.
Sicilian writes:
It's all right!
Gaddafi has always been on the Serbian side...
Soko observes:
He seems to believe more in Serbs...
Libya has not recognized Kosovo, another reason to support Gaddafi.
Donald 1408, a Serbian military officer, recalls:
Hey, gentlemen, what's so weird about it?
I know they were in Russian schools too.
Gaddafi's military experts appreciated the school in Yugoslavia...
I knew how to recruit the best to join the Libyan army...
Many of them went to help Libyans with special contracts... personally, I have an offer to go there, and I know I have many colleagues who were...
Visitors to the ultra-right-wing forum "Stormfront" also analyze the alleged involvement of Serbian "war dogs" in Libya.
This is what you get if you're a mercenary in Libya:

A declaration of love for the Portuguese language, in all its variants
The Portuguese language, spoken by more than 200 million people worldwide, has often been described as the "homeland" or "motherland" of the Portuguese-speaking world.
On 21 February we commemorate the International Mother Language Day, which was established by UNESCO in 1999.
In a tribute to the Portuguese language in all its linguistic and cultural diversity, we invite you in this article to browse the reflections of Portuguese-speaking bloggers, provoked by their reading of the first novel dedicated to the Portuguese language, Milagrário Pessoal - the latest work by the Angolan author José Eduardo Agualusa.
The title of this article is taken from the blog Mértola, in which Carlos Viegas writes that Milagrário Pessoal is:
Cameroon: Police use violence against protesters
Opposition groups in Cameroon organized protests on Wednesday, February 23, 2011, to demand President Paul Biya step down from power.
The President wants to run again as a presidential candidate this year; he's been in power for 28 years.
His Special Intervention Brigade crushed the protest with force.
Writing about the protests, Eliza Anyangwe wonders why the protests in sub-Saharan Africa are not in the news:
Saudi women demand their rights, on Twitter
It's a time of change in the Middle East and the Arab world and Saudi women don't want to be left behind.
Now they're demanding equality online - on Twitter, Facebook, forums and blogs.
Deborah Amos at Georgia Public Broadcasting, reports that recent events have sparked political passions in Saudi Arabia:
"Duraa Ali, a 22-year-old journalism student, dressed in a hijab and veiled face, asked on the forum if a woman could start a revolution in Saudi Arabia.
Women are the ones who have the least rights, he said amidst applause in the room.
Ali was studying in Bahrain when the protests began there.
She was very excited by the demands of Shiite protesters who challenged the Sunni royal family and disturbed by the violent reaction to the demands".
Twitter #saudiwomenrevolution has a considerable number of followers and more tweets in support and sometimes against the demands of women are added every day.
Here is a snippet of the tweets from #saudiwomenrevolution
On Facebook, the Saudi Women's Revolution page has 591 followers and continues to grow.
Although most of the articles here are in Arabic, there are some comments in English and it has attracted the support of non-Muslim men and women from various parts of the world.
The cartoons depicting Saudi women and their daily struggles are revealing, and some very moving.
As global support for Saudi women grows, the authorities are certainly uncomfortable with the awakening of political awareness among the public.
James Nixon on Thniq says:
"A group of intellectuals, human rights activists and lawyers gathered on February 10 to form Saudi Arabia's first political party, the Islamic Umma Party, demanding the end of the country's absolute monarchy.
It will be hard for Saudi women and women calling for change, but as events in Tunisia and Egypt show - the power of the people can never be ignored for long.
Bahrain: Day of Mourning Celebrated
This post is part of our special coverage of Protests in Bahrain 2011.
Friday 25 February was chosen as 'Day of Mourning' by all the martyrs who died since the Anger Day protests, which began on 14 February 2011.
Blogger Mahmood Al-Yousif reflects on this Day of Mourning in his last post:
Bahrain: Protests in schools (Video)
This post is part of our special coverage of the protests in Bahrain 2011.
On Tuesday, March 1, several high schools organized anti-government protests throughout Bahrain.
Boys and girls schools in Ciudad Isa, Ciudad Hamad and Jidhafs marched in the middle of the school day to support the protesters camped in Glorieta Perla (Lulu).
Schools in Ciudad Isa addressed the Ministry of Education amid petitions for the resignation of the education minister and protests over the system of voluntary teachers adopted when teachers declared themselves on strike to support the Glorieta Perla protesters and fallen martyrs.

Video: Learning a new language through online videos
The 21st of February was the International Mother Language Day and this year's theme was on linguistic diversity and new technologies.
With this in mind, we offer a series of examples that show how some people celebrate and share their mother tongue with others through online videos and web pages.

Our first language stop is the Aymara.
This language, spoken by more than two million people, is spoken in Bolivia, Peru and Chile, and is recognized as an official language in the first two countries mentioned.
Aymara speakers are increasingly active on the web through projects like Jaqi Aru in El Alto (Bolivia) and, thanks to their translation efforts, Global Voices is now available in Aymara.
Below, through this short video made by Choice Humanitarian Org, we can learn a few phrases in Aymara through its native speakers:
Learning through songs is a fun way to do it, and not just for kids.
The next musical lesson will teach us how to greet people in Swahili, which is the lingua franca or common language in most of East Africa.
Global Voices Online (GVO) is deeply concerned about linguistic diversity and multilingualism.
GVO is made up of translators, authors and publishers who speak or write in more than one language.
Many of our readers are also bilingual, but we work very hard for those who do not speak English as a second language and who deserve to be able to read content in their native language from all parts of the world.

Brazil: Tragedy in Critical Mass - Accident or Murder?
From the website: "Together for a more humane transit, for more beautiful and cheerful cities, for a more breathable world: we are all part of Critical Mass".
Critical Mass is an event that takes place in more than 300 cities around the world, when tens, hundreds or even thousands of cyclists gather on the streets to urge the use of bicycles as an alternative mode of transportation to motorized and polluting vehicles.
On the last Friday of February, the city of Porto Alegre in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, held its own Critical Mass, but on February 25, 2011, a tragedy occurred.
Guilherme Valadares of the blog Papo de Homem (Charla de hombres) explains:
@JessyAntonielle: If it was "without intent to kill", why did Ricardo José Neif abandon his car after the incident? #massacriticapoa
Do you have permission to pedal?
@luciouberdan: Does police chief Gilberto Almeida Montenegro @policiacivilrs not understand that the bike is a vehicle, and therefore it is a transit? #MassaCriticaPOA @tuliovianna: Police investigate cyclist hitchhiking: http://is.gd/f3mrHo Do you get bad injuries?!
That's an attempted murder by mistake!
There was no shortage of criticism of the coverage of the incident by local media, who treated it as a mere traffic accident.
Lucio Uberdan of Autogestionário Brazil comments:
A move that proposes replacing the use of the car with the bicycle ends up being, in this context, an action of inconsistent , quijotes  facing  windmills  and therefore, nothing more logical than  ending the clown  (perhaps that was not only the thought of the driver who caused the accident, but also that of many readers of the newspaper).
In the corner of José do Patrocínio with Luiz Afonso, the Masa Crítica of Porto Alegre suffered an assassination attempt, and does not deceive when reading ACCIDENTE on RBS and others.
A report by Igor Natusch, from the blog Sul21 (Sur21) shows that the hit-and-run on the cyclists was deliberate.
Helton Scheer de Moraes, in a testimony reproduced on the Masa Crítica group blog, was one of the first to be hit by the car and comments:
The driver scratched no one: he pushed, incidentally, a cyclist/bicycle with his car, threateningly, at least once after the mass hit. (...)
He had already surrounded them since the start of the demonstration, that is, there are at least 500 meters, simply because the bikes were circulating all over the track, as is typical of Critical Mass.
The Rio Grande do Sul Public Ministry will prosecute him for "attempted homicide, because it was a vain reason and the action made it difficult for the victims to defend themselves".
Ricardo Neif has a history of driving in the opposite direction, driving on the tracks and being extremely aggressive.
- It's because I'm from Porto Alegre.

Japan: Citizens' videos of the earthquake
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Japan earthquake.
You have to admire people with the ingenuity to keep a video camera filming while the earth is shaking beneath them.
Citizen videos recorded on March 11 during the earthquake and tsunami that caused massive devastation in many parts of Japan are all over YouTube.
Among the many who have shared online, here are a few.
The Day of the Great Tremor
Employees at a supermarket in Tokyo hold the shelves during an earthquake that lasted almost a minute.
As the earthquake shakes a house, the people inside rush out into the street.
These people watch from a high part the tsunami sinking the port of Iioka in Chiba Prefecture.

Yemen: End of the game for Ali Abdullah Saleh?
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 protests in Yemen.
March 18 was the bloodiest day since the uprising began in Yemen nearly two months ago, with Ali Abdullah Saleh calling on security forces to protect both pro- and anti-government protesters.
On Monday, Ali Muhsen, a senior Yemeni army officer, declared his support for "the peaceful youth revolution and its demands".
The military commander of the northern region, Ali Muhsen, on Monday declared his support for the peaceful revolution against the 33-year-old regime of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
General Mussen, one of President Saleh's relatives, is considered the second most influential military commander after Saleh.
Later on Monday, Ali Muhsen's action was followed by a massive wave of resignations from Yemeni officers, ambassadors, army generals and members of Parliament.
Hameer Al-Ahmer, the Deputy Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Yemen's ambassador to the Czech Republic, the Director of Yemeni Television, and the Governor of Aden are on this long list.

Myanmar: Photos of the earthquake
A 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook northeastern Myanmar on the night of Thursday, March 24, 2011.
The earthquake, which could be felt in neighboring Thailand and even in Vietnam and China, killed at least 70 people and destroyed more than 240 buildings in Myanmar alone.
Strong movements were also recorded in the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in Thailand.
The death toll could rise.
According to some reports, more than 80 coffins were sold in Tachileik on Friday morning.
Observers have described the earthquake as the third most serious natural disaster in Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis (2008) and Cyclone Giri (2010).
The independent newspaper The Irrawaddy has interviewed some residents of Mae Sai, Thailand.
In a letter published in the Shan Herald, Jai Noi recounted the impact of the earthquake on residents.
Dear ones, we've all been up all night, sleeping in rats while trying to stay awake.
The phone doesn't work well, the cell phone or the landline.
So far, the house has not been damaged.
We've been in and out all night.
I hope this email gets here.
There's a lot of damage in Taler, 40 km north, and the bridge is broken.
I heard most of the city was torn down and there's only one doctor there, so they sent more wounded to Tachileik than can be treated there.
At least 80 dead, I still don't have any more details.
I'm sure there'll be more wounded.
The epicenter, as reported in the news, was near Merng Lain, 59 km north of Maesai.
So far, there are still replicas.
The blog akm-kuntha has posted photos showing the damage on the roads of Tarle, a city 30 km from Tachileik.
Democratic Voice of Burma has also published photos of the disaster.
Below I transcribe some reactions on Twitter from Yangon.
@ascmmr Dear Fans, we hope you are safe and sound from the earthquake.
If you felt the earthquake on March 24, 2011 at 8:25 pm
@minnyoonthit The earthquake has caused severe damage in northern Shan, Tachileik area (more than 100 dead and several injured).

The murder of the son of journalist and poet Javier Sicilia, which took place in the state of Morelos at the end of March this year, revived the wave of indignation in Mexico against violence and gave rise to the marches mentioned.
Mexicans protesting violence at the Zócalo in Mexico City.
Víctor Hernández, whose opinion appears on the Michoacán in Resistance blog, celebrated that the marches were the product of the citizen's organization and not a media campaign orchestrated by some political stream:
Poetised and politicized, multiclassicists and indignant, more than 10 thousand people marched from the explanada de Bellas Artes to the Zócalo of Mexico City to protest the effects of the war on drugs, while another 8 thousand citizens, headed by the poet and journalist Javier Sicilia, protested in Cuernavaca, the epicenter of this simultaneous protest, following the execution of 7 young people on March 28 in Temixco, Morelos.

The Commission is also responsible for the implementation of the European Union's environmental policy.
And what's the solution?
I think all that is useless, violence is being perpetrated by hitmen without a social background, uneducated guys most of the time, drug addicts, alcoholics, dehumanized people for whom killing someone is like a salesman making a sale.
Peru: Reactions after the first round of elections 2011

The day after the election in Peru, the results are clear: there will be a second round, and so far, according to official figures from the National Office of Electoral Processes (ONPE), at 72,373% of the registered voting records, Keiko Fujimori extends her lead over Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and will be the rival of Ollanta Humala, who gets the first place with 29.02% of the votes.
Given that the ONPE count is a count of votes scrutinized, not a representative sample, it is clear that as votes from the electoral acts coming from different corners of the country are added, the results of Fujimori and Kuczynski may temporarily cross over; but as we approach the total votes scrutinized it will be unlikely that the trend expressed in the ballot polls (Ollanta Humala first, Keiko Fujimori second, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski third) will change substantially.
Bloggers, candidates and analysts agree that this result is primarily "an angry vote", a vote of punishment for the economic policies handled by governments in recent years, which have encouraged growth and created a new prosperity that, curiously, does not reach everyone equally, but has instead increased the gap between the ends of the socioeconomic scale.
Roger Merino explains this clearly in his blog Legal Comparison and Critical Analysis:
Colombia: Indigenous communities protect their food security
Indigenous communities in Colombia are taking steps to protect their food security.
Not only are they instructing their communities to eat what their gardens produce instead of buying expensive food brought from abroad, but they are also protesting against new laws and regulations that restrict their access to milk.
Products sown in indigenous communities
In the following two videos, we can see the Misak indigenous community marching to the capital city of Bogotá to protest a new law that says that selling raw milk is illegal.
In their communities, where they buy milk from neighbors and supplement their diets locally, putting restrictions on raw milk would mean they would have to buy processed milk at a much higher price, affecting both milk producers and sellers.
These videos are titled "Milk and cans don't kill, hunger does".
You can follow this and other activities of indigenous communities in Colombia on their website in Spanish.
Interview with Gaël Brassac, translator at Global Voices
This interview is part of our series of portraits of Global Voices contributors.
Translators are behind the scenes collaborators that allow Global Voices readers to access our content in other languages.
Gaël Brassac, translator for Global Voices, in Kyoto in April 2010.
Interest in a particular country is often one of the reasons a reader becomes a Global Voices contributor.
Japan is at the center of Gaël's concerns at the moment, but it was his interest in Bangladesh that led him to discover Global Voices.
See here other portraits of Global Voices bloggers and translators from around the world.
Did you read Global Voices often before you started translating into French?
Gael Brassac: I discovered Global Voices in early 2009 at university, when I was doing research on the close monitoring of geopolitical conflicts in Asian countries.
The sources of information were rare in the press, but I found a very good article by collaborator Rezwan on Global Voices, and it helped me a lot! Gradually, I started translating for the website and now I collaborate as an author.
Which of the Global Voices articles you have translated has impacted you the most?
GB: One of the first things I translated was about Egypt in June 2010, 'My name was Khalid and I wasn't a terrorist.'
It explained why this young Egyptian, who had incriminating videos of local police, was killed by those same officers.
I preferred to commit to something where solidarity and human beings were the main thing, not money.
Now, I'm looking for humanitarian work in France, Japan or anywhere.
GB: The week after the earthquake in Japan, the tsunami and the radiation leaks, I was very tense.
I followed the news closely but much of the conflicting information in the traditional media gradually discouraged me, and to avoid being so limited, I chose a single source of information, a forum.
When a disaster like this happens in a country where you have such good memories, a girlfriend, friends, and where you aspire to live, it's hard to handle.
But I am sure that Japan will move forward as it did after World War II, and I hope that it will adopt a progressive policy of sustainable energy and make the right decision, just as it did when they wrote Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution of 1946 when they gave up the war forever.
Chile: Let seeks to get riders off the track to the tracks
Blogger Setty criticizes a law that "tries to ban bicycles on the street, and that puts the city's growing cyclist population on the road".
Bolivia: Sharing a meal with Aymara women
Pablo Andrés Rivero blogs about a "ritual, collective food of the Andean region" he shared with Aymara women in the municipality of Palca, near La Paz.
When he was almost finished eating, one of the women asked him, "What do you eat in your country?" which prompted Andrés to reflect on the non-physical distance between the Aymara community and Bolivians like him.
There's nothing like a change in the climate to make people talk.
The reactions on Twitter were a mix of stunning, overwhelming, confusing and wishes for more to come.
Monday night showed a certain omen of the pleasant gift that was to come.
Winds are rising, gusting 50kph afterwards... and rain forecast (maybe storms?!) from 6pm onwards.
But the drops started in the afternoon, stopping and starting sporadically throughout the rest of the day.

Peru: Second round of elections
Candidates Ollanta Humala and Keiko Fujimori are also present.

A few weeks before the second round of Peruvian elections, to choose between Ghana's Peruvian candidate Ollanta Humala Tasso and former president Alberto Fujimori's daughter Keiko Sofía Fujimori (for Force 2011), the increasing polarization of Peruvian society, and therefore of the electorate, is visible in both the press and social media.
The most prominent news these days is the recent dismissal of two journalists from the local news channel Canal N, owned by Grupo El Comercio, allegedly for failing to follow the directions to make a biased coverage in favor of Keiko Fujimori.
This has generated expressions of rejection from both the journalists' organizations and the colleagues of the dismissed.
Journalist Raúl Tola, a colleague of Patricia Montero and José Jara, asks himself in his column in the newspaper La República:
Honduras to implement the One Laptop Per Child programme
RNS at Honduras Politics and Culture says the plan to give an XO laptop to every child in Honduras "would be ideal for the development of Honduras".
However, the blogger is somewhat skeptical: "At the current cost, the original $3 million investment would buy 15075 XO laptops, not the 8000 computers specified in the article".
Iraq: Is Saddam still alive?
Saddam Hussein is making a round of social media visits, where a new recording claims that the Iraqi dictator is alive and well and that it was his double Mikhail who was executed on December 30, 2006.
Many internet users have been quick to describe the video as fake and assure readers that Saddam is dead and buried.If he were alive, the former Iraqi dictator would have turned 74 on Thursday 28th.
Saddam Hussein was executed in 2006, why wait all those years to announce to the whole world that he is alive!!!?
The Iraqi youth are tired of occupation, tired of division whether sectarian or ethnic and they want to restore Iraq united and independent.
From Saudi Arabia, Sultan Al Sulami smells something wrong:
Today is the birthday of the President of the Republic of Iraq, the martyr Saddam Hussein.
Kuwait: Blogger wins the lawsuit
Congratulations flow after Kuwait-based Lebanese blogger Mark won a lawsuit.
He was sued by a restaurant for a review he posted on his blog.
Puerto Rico: Domestic violence debate continues
A few blogs have been following closely the decision of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico that victims of violence who are in adulterous relationships cannot be protected under Law 54 against Domestic Violence.
And recently, the Court of Appeals of San Juan (the capital city) ruled that another woman victim of domestic violence could not receive the protection offered by Law 54 because, allegedly, the relationship with the aggressor was purely sexual.
It would be a mistake to assume that this right-wing faction is guided in its zeal by some very conservative political or judicial ideology or principle.
It does not seem to be guided by any judicial or political principle, only by a partisan, cultural and perhaps religious loyalty.
Mexico prepares for a massive national protest on May 8
On Sunday, May 8, Mexican citizens will march to demand the end of the "War on Narco" and the resignation of all government officials responsible for more than 35,000 deaths and the rise of insecurity and corruption.
Mexican poet Javier Sicilia, who became the leading voice of discontent over the government's approach to tackling drug trafficking after his son Juan Francisco was killed, is inviting all who desire 'peace and justice' to join the protests next Sunday.
Here is the message from Javier Sicilia:
The protest began on May 5 in Cuernavaca, a city near the capital, where the son of Sicily was killed, and will head to the National University (UNAM) in Mexico City.
Neftali Granados (@NeftaliGranados) tweeted the route to follow.
The itinerary of the protest in Mexico is available on the official website of Red Paz y Justicia.
A Facebook page has also been opened to spread details.
In addition, there will be an official blog dedicated to the details of the various protests across the country.
The newspaper La Jornada fully supports the protest and constantly publishes editorial articles to push the goals of the May 8 protests.
Professor John M. Ackerman, a strong and respected voice in Mexican civil society, wrote:
Bolivia: Keeping the Aymara alive through TV?
Mr. Lukaña Champi wonders why Bolivia does not have a TV channel in Aymara or Quechua, considering that the country is run by an 'indigenous government': "Modern media, such as radio and television are ways of keeping a language alive and in full use.
When a language is not used, that language dies".
Egypt: Companies help the government spy on activists
One of the demands of the Egyptian revolution was the dissolution of the State Security Investigations and the prosecution of its officials, one of the most well-known security services for torture, human rights violations and espionage of activists.
A few weeks ago, after not getting a response from the authorities, some Egyptian citizens stormed the SSI headquarters to protect evidence that incriminated different departments of the agency (including torture equipment and documents), including communications between SSI units related to censorship, online content tracking, computer and laptop control, and the closure of communication services.
In my opinion, all those individuals and entities working for the right to privacy, freedom of expression and other relevant areas should understand and be aware of the information provided by those documents.
Since the first protest in Egypt took place on 6 April 2008, security agencies and services decided to pay more attention to communications between activists via the Internet or mobile devices.
Closing certain Internet sites.
Disrupt cell phone service at telecommunications companies.
The SSI met several times with representatives of the Ministry of Interior, the General Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technologies and the three telecommunications companies in Egypt (Vodafone, Mobinil, Etisalat).
In these statements made between different departments of the SSI, it is mentioned that the price of the software, called Finfisher, was 2 million Egyptian pounds.
Here you can see how Gamma Group International is described on its website: It offers advanced technical surveillance and international monitoring and advisory solutions to National and State Intelligence Departments and State Security Agencies".
The most recent communication is dated 1 January 2011 and is a report by an IT department of SSI after using a test version of the software.
This kind of program developed by Gamma International and similar simply helps governments and agencies belonging to the regimes in power to violate the privacy of citizens, control their activities and impose censorship.
The same is true of the telecommunications companies in Egypt that cooperated with Mubarak's regime to obtain information from activists and disrupt services.

Ecuador: Three years after the Factory tragedy
Factory never again.
Image provided by Juan Arellano
On April 19, 2008, three years have passed since the tragedy known as the Caso Factory, or the Factory distillery fire in Quito, while a gothic rock festival was being held there.
As a result of the fire, 19 people were killed and 24 injured.
Among the dead were all members of the rock band Zelestial, and so far some of the survivors are suffering the aftermath of the tragedy.
Although there was a trial and sentencing for the case, the collective of relatives and friends of the deceased continue to gather to demand justice and above all not excluding rockers of various trends, allowing them to meet and present themselves anywhere in the city and not just in remote and questionable places.
Spain: Earthquake shakes Murcia
Lorca, in the region of Murcia, Spain, was shaken by two earthquakes on May 11.
The magnitude 4.5 and 5.1 earthquakes on the Richter scale, and the subsequent aftershocks, have left a balance of nine dead so far and about 300 injured.
Thousands of damned have been forced into shelters.
Damn in the streets of Lorca.

The solidarity towards the call City of the Sun  was immediately felt through Twitter, under the hashtags #terremotomurcia and #todosconlorca that have been used to inform and show solidarity.
On Facebook, the Murcia Earthquake Support account has been opened, which already has thousands of messages, and on blogs of Murcians who share their sorrow, such as Maria's at the Atelier.

I only hope that this solidarity country, which can allocate hundreds of millions of euros to the most pilgrim causes, will turn to help and rebuild, and I mean the government that is trying to get rid of us, to see where ZP goes, will be worth seeing.
There are also criticisms of the lack of immediate intervention to help those who were left without a roof on the first night, contrary to what is reported in official media.
As Kaos writes on the net:
This post is part of a special coverage of the death of Osama Bin Laden.
For the US government, "Geronimo EKIA" (meaning: "Enemy killed in action") is the code for killing Osama Bin Laden.
For many Native Americans, however, comparing their tribal hero Geronimo to the world's number one terrorist is offensive.
Gerónimo was the most famous Chiricahua Apache figure who fought against Mexican and American armies to defend Apache lands.

It also serves to project the United States in a better light.
We are, after all, magnates in victory.
They won the fight by beating a legend.

In memory of Paulina Aguilera Muñoz, author of Global Voices
The news came via an email from her younger sister, Claudia: Paulina Aguilera Muñoz, Chilean author of Global Voices, had died unexpectedly.
As regional editor of Latin America for Global Voices, I had been in contact with Paulina the day before, working on a post about a blogger who had been arrested in Ecuador for alleged offenses against the Attorney General.
The news of his death was shocking and heartbreaking to the Global Voices community.
A journalist by profession and mother of two, Paulina has worked in Argentina, Nicaragua, Ecuador and Colombia on development, human rights, gender and communications issues.
He was running the blogs Various Worlds for Vagabonds/as and Kanguro: Safe and Cheap Tourism.
There were countless messages of condolences and love as soon as I shared the news on our community's distribution lists.
From all over Latin America, as well as from far away, like India, Serbia, South Korea, Sweden, Bahrain, Maldives, Peru, Tanzania, Ukraine, Tunisia, France, Pakistan and the United States, her friends miss and remember her.
Solana Larsen, Global Voices' Editor-in-Chief, wrote: "I remember her as someone cheerful and funny on the distribution list and also as a blogger who was enthusiastic and energetic in defending women's rights and indigenous rights", pointing to a post Paulina wrote on her personal blog for Blog Action Day, where she wrote about clean water as a right of indigenous peoples.
Chilean author Felipe Cordero said he admired Paulina's dedication to covering human rights issues in Chile and Latin America for Global Voices.
Firuzeh Shokooh Valle, our Spanish publisher, recalled how much she enjoyed Paulina's post about Natividad Llanquileo, the indigenous spokeswoman for the Mapuche on hunger strike in Chile.
Ela Stapley, a translator for Global Voices, mentioned Paulina's coverage of a prison fire in Chile: "I liked this post from her especially because it was about people that society prefers to forget.
When I wrote it, it reminded us that prisoners are people too".
Paulina was a key contributor to the coverage of the police strike that took place in Ecuador on September 30, 2010.
Global Voices will miss their dedication, professionalism and enthusiasm.
I will personally remember her as a friend and an exemplary woman.
Iran: Dogs arrested (again)
Iranian security forces are back on the streets for a sequel to their infamous 2007 action: Arresting Dogs.
The last offensive was short-lived and the dogs were released soon.
According to the Iranian press, several dogs were recently confiscated and moved "temporarily to prison".
It is possible that because the people most likely to keep dogs are the urban and educated youth of Iran, dogs may be generating more official hostility again.
Animal Persian blog writes with humor and irony about what serious crimes animal lovers in Iran may be prosecuted for in the future:
Animal Persian publishes a parody image of a 'crime scene' where the owner is labeled as 'criminal' and the dog is the 'object of the crime'.
Spain: Thousands take to the streets
Spanish citizens have taken to the streets this week to protest against corruption, poverty, unemployment and a political structure that favors a two-party system.
The image is from Juan Luis Sánchez.
Ignacio Escolar in Público reports:
#15m, #15mani and #democraciarealya were the most actively used comments on Twitter tags related to the May 15 protests, to distribute thousands of links to photos and videos of the demonstrations in 50 cities, and news of the upcoming elections and citizens' requests.
This is one of the most tweeted messages on May 16th:

Iran: Campaign against homophobia: "We are everywhere"
Arsham Parsi is the founder and director of the Iranian Gay Organization based in Toronto, Canada.
In 2008, he told Global Voices, "The Internet has been a gift to us".
On May 17th of this year, International Homophobia Day, several Iranians once again used this "gift" to raise their voices with the launch of the "We're Everywhere" campaign on YouTube, Facebook and blogs, against homophobia worldwide.
I hope that one day when I say I'm gay, I'm not accused of being a sinner or mistreated.
My gay experience started with falling in love and I think everyone can feel that in this world.
I hope our days have a great sun, a rainbow and are delighted to be able to speak without fear.
Brazil: Forest defender shot dead

The Caribbean: Reflections on the End of the World
The world was supposed to end on Saturday the 21st - at least, according to some religious sects.

The Jamaican blogger Stunner's Afflictions was... say... amazed to discover that:
World economy: Women reflect on poverty, work and debt
The International Women's Museum's online exhibition on Women and the Economy features slides, podcasts, videos and essays about women from countries such as Sudan, Denmark, the Philippines, the United States, Costa Rica, Mexico and Argentina and how they perceive issues such as poverty, business, family, rights, money and more.
Economics, the IMOW interactive online exhibition, aims to explore the contribution of women to the global economy.
Images of Power and Potential, was a photo exhibition with a jury that showed the different ways in which women participate in the economy and their role as agents of change.
For example, the Community Choice award winner was Brenda Paik Suno, a third-generation Korean-American who took pictures of a 'Grandmother Jeju of the Sea', who has been involved in the tradition of women harvesting at sea for generations.
The divers of the Jeju Islands.
This is Brenda Paik Suno.
Focusing on Latin America gives us insights into how the global crisis affected women in three different countries in the region, Mexico, Costa Rica and Argentina, and how they faced the new challenges, caused by their countries' continued increasing participation in the world economy.
Young Women Talk Economics asked women from four different countries to share their thoughts on various economic issues.
Ally Zeifman addressed the issue of relative poverty through audio interviews.
He started by asking people in Denmark if they thought there was poverty in Denmark, and then interviewing a woman who thinks she is one of the invisible poor people in Denmark.
On the project page you can read an introduction to the subject and see photo passes with quotes from the interview that illustrate the life of a poor person in Denmark.
Some of the quotes like "I graduated from college but I'm unemployed", "My son was very keen to play football but I don't have to pay for all the shoes and sports items so in the end I decided it was better to put food on the table" and "I know I'm not poor like in Africa but I have to say 'no' often" resonate with all those who have been in a difficult economic situation.
Valeene Salanga of the Philippines reflects on how even a university education does not guarantee a better future, since getting a first job means traveling down a road full of obstacles she hadn't counted on, as a graduate:
There's a lot more to see, read and hear in Economics, and women can also participate and deliver their own creative work that focuses on economics.
Ukraine: Blogging to find a new identity of its own
For someone who lives with a drug addiction, becoming a substitution therapy patient involves significant changes in their life.
The process of returning to normal life from a life of injectable drug use requires not only lifestyle changes, but also changes at the psychological level.
For some, blogging can be one of the tools to help in an introspective look and to discuss concerns with like-minded people.Bloggers who live with drug addiction and who are part of the Association of Substitution Treatment Advocates post a lot about their emotional experience associated with their participation in harm reduction programs.
Mexico: Teacher sings with students during a shooting
The YouTube video showing a kindergarten teacher singing with her students to keep them calm during a shooting in Monterrey, Mexico, has been almost viral across Spanish-speaking countries.
The video recorded by the teacher with a cell phone shows a room full of very young children lying on the floor.
It is heard that the teacher gently asks her students to keep their heads down, sticking to the floor, while gunshots are heard in the background.
She reassures the children that everything is fine, and that they will be safe inside the classroom, and reminds them to keep their heads down.
To distract them, she starts singing with them.
Choose the song of the Rain Drop from Barney's show in Spanish, which talks about what would happen if the rain drops were made of chocolate and how they would open their mouths wide to drink them.
By making the children sing the song, he not only kept them calm but also managed to keep their heads glued to the floor, while asking them to turn upward to look up at the sky with their mouths open.
Local media have identified the school as being located in the Colonia Nueva Estanzuela, just meters from where a group armed with seven pickup trucks went on to murder five people in an independent taxi stop, and the teacher, whose identity is still unknown, has been called a hero and has been recognized by the media and viewers for her bravery, character and love for her pupils.

This post is part of our special coverage of the War on Drug Trafficking in Mexico.
"Stop the bullets, paint the fountains" is a social movement that calls for justice and recalls the actions of the Mexican government in several crimes that have not had a clear judicial process.
To the astonishment of pedestrians who circled around the capital during the last weekend of May, activists dyed the water of the famous statue of "Diana la Cazadora" in the Paseo de la Reforma - one of the most important avenues in Mexico City - red.
The police tried to stop the protest, but thanks to its peaceful nature, the participants were allowed to continue their demonstration.
Determining the identity of all murder victims is an indispensable exercise in building trust.
Mexican Twitter users also expressed their ideas.
In addition, Aideé Stephanie (@lajimenezmx) spoke of the damage this protest could cause:

This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Japan Earthquake.
More than two months have passed since the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami that struck Japan, and while those not directly affected by the disaster have been able to return to their normal lives, some 110,000 people are still living in evacuation centers, according to police estimates.
Lack of privacy, separation from their communities of origin, unemployment and deep grief over the loss of loved ones has been a heartbreaking experience for many victims who are physically and emotionally exhausted.

Iran: Women's rights activist dies at father's funeral
Iranian women's rights activist Haleh Sahabi died on Tuesday 31 May as a result of beating by security agents during the funeral of her father, Ezatollah Sahabi, a veteran political leader.
Haleh was leading the procession with flowers and a photo of his father, when officers dressed in civilian robes broke in and tried to break the photo.
According to witnesses, the security officers used stakes.
His death made headlines on several news websites.
Another blogger, Artenoos, wrote:
Haleh (56) was a women's rights activist and a Quranic researcher.
She was detained on 5 August 2009, when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was elected for a second term.
I believed that equality between men and women can be found if you read the Quran through a woman's prism and concerns.
Does no one remember, "You get something, you get something if you finish it"?
Peru: Aymara Indigenous People announce Restart of Protests in Puno

Puno, Peru (photo: J. Enrique Molina)
It should be remembered that in the past few days, about 15,000 Aymara took over the city of Puno, after which violent incidents arose that paralyzed the Punjabi capital for several days and left many tourists stranded.
The Puno region, far from the capital Lima, bordering Bolivia, is the second largest in the number of hectares granted for mining projects in Peru, according to the scholar José de Echave.
The Central Government has rejected the cancellation, but reached an agreement with the Aymara communities to suspend mining and oil concessions in Puno for 14 months in four provinces (Yunguyo, Chucuito, Collao and Juli).
However, these indigenous communities also demand that Supreme Decree 082-2007-EM be repealed, said Walter Aduviri, President of the Natural Resources Defense Front in the southern Puno area.
Aduviri told the Punjabi newspaper Los Andes that although they felt positive about the victory of nationalist candidate Ollanta Humala, the Aymara will not conform to promises, but demand written agreements.
Lake Titicaca, whose ecology would be affected by mining and oil activities according to Aymara activists (Photo: J. Enrique Molina)
The Quechua and Aymara peoples of Puno do not oppose mining completely, but want to be included in the licensing process, to define where it is convenient to extract minerals to avoid contaminating the basins of their rivers and reaching Lake Titicaca.
Nevertheless, they cultivate more than a thousand varieties of native potatoes and hold the first place in national production of this tuber.
Colombia: Robbery at the Andean Parliament building
On June 7, the headquarters of the Andean Parliament in Bogotá, Colombia was stormed.
The Andean Parliament is the control body of the Andean Community, a regional body comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru with the aim of achieving "comprehensive, more balanced and autonomous development through Andean, South American and Latin American integration".
The blog Planeta al día reports the news as follows:
Tapia is a boxing show host on Thursdays at 9pm.
The first few minutes are always devoted to political reflections and criticisms, which in many cases generate rejection and in others sympathy.
It is one of the most popular shows on Panamanian television and the reactions around his possible candidacy were unexpected.
Panamanian blogger Leslie Martinez writes in her blog Bla bla bla of a Panamanian her stance on this:

China: Internet users are running for the next election
Originally published on 26 May 2011.
Amid news of the Fuzhou explosions, something unusual was happening on Sina Weibo: Earlier this week, citizens across the country began announcing their decision to run as independent candidates for the local elections to the People's Congress at the municipal district level to be held next fall.
This vote is open to the public.
Among them are journalists Li Chengpeng and Yao Bo.
Although there are precedents (Yao Lifa's victory in 1998, which gave him a seat in the municipal People's Congress in Hubei province and made many others try to follow in his footsteps), Weibo's list is unique because of the popularity of several of the participants and the fact that almost all of them have started campaigning on their microblogs.

Since then, several formal meetings have been held with the support of the International Financial Corporation in Cambodia.
The first informal meeting was successfully organised in the first week of June, with the support of individual donations.
On June 3, about 40 members of the group met to discuss Facebook's role in business development.
The meeting was attended by bloggers, online entrepreneurs, businesswomen and civil organizations.

The debate initially dealt with the emergence of new social communication tools that can reach a larger and more specialized target audience, compared to traditional media.
Then, panelists and attendees shared some tips on how to improve their business expansion on Facebook.

Ethan Zuckerman, co-founder of Global Voices and longtime fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, has been appointed director of the MIT Center for Citizen Media and senior scientific researcher at the MIT Media Laboratories.
The research center (formerly known as the Center for Citizen Media Futures) was founded in 2007 with the support of the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation to explore the opportunities and challenges of news and information in a digital era.
And that's a topic that's really central and a priority for much of the work being done at the Center for Citizen Media Futures.
In his blog, Ethan says he is excited that the Center will work on a combination of practical and theoretical projects:

Lightbulbs, dances, flowers, and bonfires were some of the elements used in celebrations around the world on the occasion of the summer and winter solstices.
We take a tour of the world to see the different celebrations: the solstice in Stonehenge, the bonfires of the Feast of St. John in Spain, the Inti Raymi in Peru, we tripantu in Chile and Kupala Day in Russia or summer night in Poland.

In A Coruña, Spain, fireworks, drinks and parades marked the festivities of the St. John's fireworks.
It is traditional for children and teenagers to jump over fireworks a certain number of times for good luck.
Sadly, this year's celebrations were marred by the deaths of two people, one of whom died stumbling while trying to jump over one of the largest fireplaces, and perished in the middle of the fire in the face of unsuccessful attempts by spectators to rescue him.
The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement.
In front of the Sacsayhuamán temple in Cusco, Peru, the traditional Inti Raymi celebration is held every year, marking the beginning of the new year for the Incas.
The last Inti Raymi celebrated by the Incas took place in 1535, after which the Catholic Church and the Spanish Conquest put an end to it.
In 1944 the celebrations were restarted, following the descriptions of the historian Inca Garcilaso de la Vega.
We Tripantu is a celebration of the Mapuche Indians to recognize the beginning of a new year at the winter solstice.
The following video shows schoolchildren in Chile dancing at a celebration of this indigenous holiday:
In the village of Maloyaroslavets in Russia, Ivan Kupala Day is celebrated, and on this summer festival, the tradition is kept alive with girls wearing flowers in their hair, community fireworks and dancing:
And last but not least, a record-breaking celebration in Poland, where thousands of paper lanterns are lit and let fly in the night sky.
The magical videos speak for themselves (through Neatorama):
Did you celebrate the solstice?

Cuba: Vote in favour of the UN Human Rights Council's LGBT resolution
On Friday, June 17, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution expressing "great concern about the acts of violence and discrimination that people suffer because of their sexual orientation...".
As part of the resolution, the Council requested a comprehensive study on discrimination against the LGBT community around the world.
The vote in favour of Cuba is a demonstration of the political will of our Party and State to eliminate all forms of discrimination that unfortunately still persist in Cuban society.
Paquito de Cuba, one of the most "noisy" LGBT advocates in the Cuban blog community, wrote about the great achievement this measure represents.
...the national printed newspapers... had no news agency office at their disposal to report on the incident.
What prevented the information provided by Cuban digital sites from being adapted to the printed versions of the newspapers?
Morocco: A new constitution with few reforms
This post is part of our special coverage of Protests in Morocco 2011.
Moroccans went to the polls on Friday 1 to vote on the reform of the new constitution offered by King Mohammed VI.
Although many analysts and monarchists have praised the reforms, they do not live up to the expectations of politicians and activists, who sought a true democracy, with separation of powers and the transfer of absolute power from the monarch to an elected parliament.
The king's offer came after four months of street protests demanding reforms that followed the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions of February 20.

Morocco: Protests for reforms continue
This post is part of the special coverage of the 2011 protests in Morocco.
On Friday 1 July 2011, Morocco voted in a referendum on the draft constitution proposed by King Mohammed VI.
The official results of the consultation indicated that support for the reform had been overwhelming, with over 98% of the votes cast for the "Yes" option.
Those protesting for democracy demanded the establishment of a parliamentary monarchy in which there was an effective separation of powers.
The pro-democracy movement responded to the announcement of the results with the denunciation that irregularities had occurred throughout the process and some bloggers have hung videos from the day of the consultation in which it is alleged that the electoral law is being violated.
The 24-Mamfakinch blog posted the following video showing unidentified individuals allegedly trying to force an election ballot after the school closed and before the counting began.
Although the referendum confirmed support for the constitutional reform, thousands took to the streets on Sunday to express their rejection of the proposal.
In addition, on that same day there were rallies in support of the monarch, who continues to enjoy great popularity.
The following videos were recorded in Tangier, Rabat and Casablanca, respectively, and posted on 24-Mamfakinch:
The protesters say the changes will not be deep enough and will continue to pressure the regime until they feel that the real reforms are being implemented.

Bulgaria: A day without Prime Minister Boyko Borisov
On 5 July 2011 an interesting challenge was presented to the traditional Bulgarian media: would they follow a Facebook call for "A Day Without Boyko Borisov" - or would they continue to report on the activities of the Bulgarian Prime Minister?
Reuters took note of the call on Facebook, and passed it through their cables, under the title that was very well placed with the organizers' intention: "Bulgars pray for a day without the busy Prime Minister Borisov".
The Commission has decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures taken are implemented in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 2 of Regulation (EC) No 1272/2003.

However, the Bulgarian media, with two memorable exceptions - the BGNES news agency and the Mediapool Internet site - did not follow the initiative and continued to include the Prime Minister in their articles.
Other bloggers also noted and wrote about the initiative, sometimes with ironic and sarcastic comments or titles for their posts, addressed to the Prime Minister.
In a very passionate and sad post, Nelly of Politics is arts was very critical of the Bulgarian media, asking why "I have to read news from foreign sites, watch foreign TV channels and prefer the opinion of bloggers over that of journalists".
Prime Minister Borisov himself announced that he was not interested in such events, and then immediately commented that he was paying the organizers the opposition.
One of the event's organizers, Mr. Atanas Palov, said this is ridiculous, and joked that if the Prime Minister paid enough, they could create an alternative event "One Day with Boyko Borisov".
The three young people (the other two are Ms Kamelia Encheva and Ms Valia Krusheva) who came up with the idea have denied political participation: one lives in Austria, one in Belgium and the other in Bulgaria, and they do not appear to have any political motivation.
It was chosen on July 5 because that day was two years since the 2009 election, in which Borisov was the winner.
At the end of the event, the organizers published an open letter, explaining that the initiative was not directed at the Prime Minister but rather towards the attention the Bulgarian media is paying to Boyko Borisov.
Wikimedia Bolivia organized the first event for local Wikipedia editors and readers
The Bolivian chapter of Wikimedia brought together local Wikipedia editors and readers for the first time.
The event included a workshop for current and future content publishers.

Videos: Tortillas, chapatis, bread and more from around the world
Puto, steamed rice cakes from the Philippines.
Most cultures accompany their meals with a cereal-based product: bread, chapatis, and steamed biscuits are part of the meals of many in different parts of the world.
We'll make the first stop in France, where baker Vicent Talleu makes croissants, chocolate napolitans and other similar products using the same paste as a base:
In India, flatbread known as roti, chapati or parottas is used for most meals and it's a spectacle to see how it's made.
Here we see a woman cooking roti chapatis in her kitchen, rolling them with a matching roller over a wooden table, cooking them in a flat metal tray or pan, and then finishing them on an open flame, where they inflate like balloons:
The following videos offer further examples of the skill of these bakers: from speed and agility in shaping, grinding and palming the chapatis to cook inside a traditional oven to a production line where they fly parottas through the air before ending up in the oven:
The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement.
Throughout Central America, corn tortilla is the staple food for much of the population.
While freshly made tortillas can be bought, some people still cook them using traditional techniques.
In Zacualtipán, in the state of Hidalgo (Mexico), a kitchen with a century of history is the stage where corn is ground or the dough is prepared on a metate stone, palming the tortilla until it gives its typical round shape and then cooking in a wood-fired oven:
This woman flatens the tortillas with a piece of plastic bag on a table so that they can be rotated comfortably while shaping them:
In Turkey, the local flatbread is called yufka.
This video shows a man turning the mass to form giant paper-like thin circles:
In the Philippines, the traditional is the poo, a steamed rice cake that can be eaten alone or with sweets and salt.
This is made with coconut milk and rice flour:
And this one is with ordinary flour, which produces something very similar to the American pancake dough, but steamed:
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat the use of the Internet.
In Colombia and Venezuela, cornmeal is used to make arepas, which are thicker than tortillas and come in different varieties and sizes.
This video was uploaded by a traveling sale of arepas from Cali, Colombia, who says where you can buy your arepas with cheese throughout the day.
Cooking blogger, chef John of Foodwishes.com, tried his luck making Venezuelan arepas, which he filled with pork, making his own version of what is known in Venezuela as "hairy" arepa:
Bolivia: Warrior Cholitas under the spotlight
For more than ten years, women's wrestling has captured the attention of locals and visitors in El Alto, Bolivia.
These women add a little tradition to this popular sport: Where else could you see rags under colorful chicks, scarves with stripes, thick braids, and bonnet hats fighting in a squadron?

Sara Shahriari and Tim Clayton collaborated on the following video about Yolanda the Lovely, a fighter from El Alto, who despite her mother's concern, climbs the squadron to fight for her right to be more than society considers "appropriate" for a woman.
Wrestling is a Bolivian experience by definition and we recommend it.
It seems that in Iran, the statues are not safe.
It would be religious motives behind the recent theft of several bronze statues in public places, depicting Iranian national heroes.
Mythological hero and Iranian archer, Arash Kamangir.
The official reason was ostentatiously that the horses in Imam Square could be interpreted as an insult to the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khomenei.
It is said that Kamangir put his own life inside his arrow and used it to expand Iran's borders.
Azarmehr writes that they are targeting more statues these days, as Iranian authorities continue their rage against Iran's pre-Islamic history.
However, since the Islamic revolution in 1979, the Islamic Republic has remained on its knees in the face of anti-Iranian agenda.
Some bloggers like Osyan Sabz have photographed the empty places that were left after the statues were removed and destroyed:
At least for Sari's riders, it's too late.

Colombia: Singer Joe Arroyo has passed away
Colombian singer Álvaro José Arroyo González, better known as Joe Arroyo, who was born in a humble neighborhood of Cartagena on November 1, 1955, died today, July 26, at 07:45 A.M. in Barranquilla, due to various organic complications that had him interned at the La Asunción Clinic in Barranquilla for 29 days to end with a cardio-respiratory break.
Joe Arroyo started his career at the age of 8 and went through several orchestras performing in the country, but became famous when he was with the orchestra Fruko and his Tesos .

Blogging Festival: Mexico - Citizenship, violence and blogs
Global Voices en Español has an interest in encouraging blogging and promoting blogger networks, and it has been thought that a good way to achieve this may be through the well-known "Blog Festivals".
In this way, while GV en Español would be helping to generate original content with a certain level of reflection and analysis, the participating bloggers would benefit from greater visibility of their work by being referenced on Global Voices.
But let's look at the details of the Festival:
Scope: Mexico
As the location and geographical area of our first Blog Festival in 2011, Mexico has been chosen, a great country that is going through a period of violence that never ceases.
Apart from that, in Mexico we have several collaborators who will support us in the dissemination of this virtual event.
While the largest number of bloggers, and the most well-known, are in Mexico City, we expect the participation of bloggers from cities like Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Ciudad Juárez and others.
We even look forward to the participation of Mexican bloggers living outside their country.
We clarify that participation is not restricted to bloggers or blogs devoted exclusively to the topic indicated in the following paragraph, any blog and blogger can participate.
Subject: Citizenship, violence and blogs
In a context like the one described, there are always stories that don't show up in traditional media, stories that are examples of resilience that we should know about.
Is it advisable to regulate media coverage of violence if that is what readers, the media, NGOs or the government would do?
Are there tangible results of campaigns of activism (on the internet or not) against violence in Mexico?
Has the use of the internet affected the prevention or visibility of violent incidents given that not all of these incidents are published in traditional media?
Could or should new media go beyond coverage and reflection?
Participation:
Any Mexican blogger can participate by posting a post on the proposed topic on their own blog.
That post has to be original, that is, the blogger's own creation, not copied from another source.
The structure, style and extent of the post are left to the blogger's discretion.
It should be made clear that the approach to the subject is open.
It may be from some of the questions suggested or from what the blogger considers appropriate.
When the blogger has posted his post for the Festival, he must communicate it to this email: juan.arellano arroba globalvoicesonline punto org indicating the following:
Name of the author
Name of the blog
Title of the post
Permanent link or URL of the post.
There's a button available, the image of this post, for bloggers to use and put on their blogs as a sign of being involved.
Once you put the button on your blog you should refer to this post.
At the end of the participation period, the participants will be sorted and summarized for the purpose of publishing a compilation post on Global Voices.
Depending on the number of shares, posts may be cited or not, mainly for reasons of space.
Timeline: Activities to be carried out within the blog festival will be as follows:
From 29 July to 10 August.
- Period of participation.
August 1 to 10.
- Selection period and preparation of the summary post with the contributions made.
August 11 to 15.
- Publishing the summary post on Global Voices in Spanish.
An additional precision: This is not a contest, so there are no winners or losers.
It is a question of seeking input, collaboration and testimonies on the proposed subject, so as to be able to draw up a broad, varied and up-to-date picture on the subject.
Participation on Twitter
On this occasion we want the Festival to be present and active on Twitter, for which we put at the disposal of all tweeter the official hashtag of the Festival: #vocesmx
With this tag will be done all the work of dissemination and call to participate in the Festival, but we also wish that there are tweets alluding to the theme of the Festival with this hashtag.
We will follow you and a selection of the most interesting will be published in our summary post.
And well, we look forward to your support, collaboration and participation!
Peru: Reactions to the inauguration ceremony of Ollanta Humala
July 28 is Peru's Independence Day and this year, too, the day Ollanta Humala took the oath of office as new president.
In Globalizado Juan Arellano, Global Voices' author and editor in Spanish, includes a post with photos and reactions on Twitter via Storify to the ceremony.
Bangladesh: Indigenous or non-indigenous, that's the question
Almost 98% of the people in Bangladesh are Bengali and speak Bengali.
Minorities include chakmas, khasis, santals and other tribes who number over a million (about 1.2% of the total population) and who mostly live in the various mountainous regions.
The chakmas are ethnically Tibetan-Burmese, and are related to the Himalayan tribes.
According to history, they originated in Arakan (now Rakhine State of Burma), which hundreds of years ago wandered and settled in different parts of India and Bangladesh.
In recent months, many Bangladeshi indigenous peoples have taken to the streets to hold meetings, human chains and demonstrations, demanding constitutional recognition of their identity.
The 'indigenous' debate arose after some comments from a special parliamentary committee working to amend the current constitution to return to the 1972 Constitution.
There were no references to tribal or indigenous peoples in Bangladesh's first Constitution of 1972, which mentioned that Bangladesh would be the land of the Bengalis.
Members of indigenous communities demanded their recognition in the Constitution as "indigenous peoples" instead of tribal or proposed "minority ethnic groups" in the central Shahidminar in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Minister of State for Cultural Affairs, Pramod Mankin said:
It is not a question of whether indigenous peoples will receive constitutional recognition.
The debate is on how they will be recognized .
The government is reluctant to recognize indigenous peoples as indigenous as it questions the ethnicity of the country's native Bengalis.
Monjurul Haque on the Indigenous Bangla blog writes about the complexity of the situation:
"In the Constitution, all minorities are generally recognized as minorities, and through the Fifteenth Amendment, the current government has listed them as 'ethnic minorities' and no longer just 'tribal peoples'".
Giving a special and elevated identity to emancipate only 1.2 percent of a total population of 150 million by stripping the 98.8 percent right cannot be in Bangladesh's national interest".
He recalled the 4000-year-old tradition of the Bengalis in this land:
The people of ethnic Bengal are not settlers, nor are they foreigners or indigenous in their own native land and never will be
Colombia: Dancing police receive footballers
In Medellín, Colombia, police officers welcomed England's under-20 football players to the airport with a dance, which left a good impression on visitors, but left some locals concerned about safety.
The city of Medellín is host to the FIFA U-20 World Cup, and the Football Association (AF) published a video of the welcome the city gave to the English U-20 team in a post titled 'A crazy Colombian welcome'.
Screenshot of the AF video.
Syria: Tanks enter Hama on the eve of Ramadan
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Syrian protests.
On the eve of Ramadan, Syrian troops have entered the city of Hama killing, according to reports, at least 45 people until 11:00 am on Sunday, July 31.
The assault has had a particular resonance for the Syrians, as the city of Hama was the scene of one of the most horrific massacres in modern history.
Most of the tweets in these early hours have been links to news, with many inside Syria and abroad condemning the killings, some expressing their fury at what they perceive as international indifference.
However, others such as deekelgen963, expressed doubts about the information coming from Hama.
Of the original reports coming through Twitter lines, one highlights.
Debkafile reports: "Water, electricity and telephone lines have been cut off for the 400,000 inhabitants of Hama".
Meanwhile, from inside Hama, some videos have come to light.
Another video shows black smoke rising from the city:
BBC journalist Shaimaa Khalil pointed to live video broadcasts broadcast from inside Hama, whose archive is still available here.
Without the presence of professional journalists in Hama, reports are based on activist and citizen journalists, who are heavily exposed when capturing these images and videos.
As a result, news often takes time to emerge, but some Syrian activists like @wissamtarif and @malathaumran are constantly tweeting news.
Mexico: Reminding the women of Ciudad Juarez
Women are not immune to this violence, and cases of femicide committed three years ago remain unsolved.
Ciudad Juárez is a border town, far north of Mexico, bordering El Paso, Texas.
It is a strategic enclave for drug and human trafficking and, as such, has suffered an unprecedented escalation of violence that today has the entire population completely terrified.
We are, without a doubt, facing a humanitarian emergency case.
These women acted courageously despite being abandoned by the state.
Finally, he talks about the future of women-led activism in Mexico:
The future of activism in Mexico is bleak: a few days ago, the house of Malú García Andrade, who runs the NGO Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa, was burned while she was protesting.
This post (originally published March 8) is part of our special coverage of the War on Drug Trafficking in Mexico.
Global Voices in Aymara: Preserving Indigenous Languages on the Net
This post is part of our special coverage of Languages and the Internet.
One of the newest Global Voices Lingua sites is also the first in an indigenous language, Aymara.
This native language is spoken by more than 2 million people across the Andes, especially in Bolivia and Peru, where it is among the official languages.
There are also people who speak Aymara in parts of Chile and Argentina, as well as Aymara living abroad.
The first translation of Global Voices into Aymara was published in September 2009 and continued with intermittent publications for the following year.
Once Victoria Tinta took over as editor, the site began producing regular translations from Global Voices in Spanish to Aymara.
In addition to text correction and translation formatting, Victoria has been responsible for recruiting and coordinating the volunteer translators team.
In total, 21 volunteers have contributed to a translation, and there is a central group of about a dozen who have done regular translations.
Global Voices editor in Aymara, Victoria Tinta at the Brazilian Digital Culture Forum in São Paulo in October 2010.
The new site is an initiative of the Jaqi Aru project based in El Alto, Bolivia and aims to contribute to the availability of content in the Aymara language on the internet, as a way to promote and preserve their native language.
Most of the translators and members of the Jaqi Aru project are students of the Department of Linguistics at the University of El Alto Public (UPEA), and have a passion for preserving the language for future generations.
The partnership with Global Voices allows the group to provide valuable content in Aymara about current events and cultural issues around the world.
Although all translators are bilingual in Aymara and Spanish, and in some cases multilingual, this translation project is still in its early stages.
In many cases, there are no words in Aymara for texts that appear in Global Voices articles.
To help in such cases, there are projects like Runasimipi that try to achieve consensus for the translation of a particular word, especially words related to technology.
But in many cases, these translations are an individual proposal for how a text should be translated. This interpretation can vary from translator to translator, but starting this way leaves room for discussion, thus helping each translator to perfect his work.
Members of the Global Voices Aymara translation team.
It may be true that most Global Voices Aymara readers have no problem reading Global Voices in Spanish as well, but the project is part of a larger goal of encouraging Aymara speakers, especially young people, to embrace their ancestral language.
Producing interesting content on the Internet is just the first step in the Jaqi Aru project and the Global Voices Aymara translation team hopes to set an example for other indigenous or minority language communities around the world.
This post is part of our special coverage of Languages and the Internet.
Before the case was brought up by the mainstream media, the online community had organized a flash mob at the university.

Honduras: Judge orders arrest of journalist and environmentalists
"A Honduran judge has issued arrest warrants to a journalist and 16 environmental leaders for allegedly opposing a forest management plan in the town of El Porvenir, in central Honduras, the Committee for Freedom of Expression (C-Libre) reported", writes Monica Medel for the Knight Center's Journalism in the Americas blog.
Togo: Journalists rally to protect press freedom
On 6 August 2011, journalists from Togo, a West African country, held a rally in the streets of the capital, Lomé, to protest the recent threats their colleagues have received.
The meeting was launched on 3 August by the Association 'SOS Journalistes en Danger'.
The flag of the Association 'SOS Journalists in Danger' in Togo
In the week before the event, several professionals in the association's media warned of threats to groups of Togolese journalists who are believed to be "criticising power".
According to Ferdinand Ayité, president of the association, the threats originated in the ANR, the National Intelligence Agency (for short in French).
Mexico: Celebrating the 100th anniversary of Cantinflas
This August, Mexico celebrates the centenary of the birth of comedian Mario Moreno, better known as Cantinflas.
In Mexico and throughout Latin America, Cantinflas is recognized as a great actor and one of Mexico's most admired comedians.
Even after his passing, Cantinflas continues to do so through his films.
Cantinflas was a symbol: with its euphemisms, its humility, warmth and, above all, its sense of humor, it represented an entire country.
Fans are celebrating Cantinflas' birthday.

Cantinflas is still a movie star in town.
In the same post he mentions the importance of Cantinflas in other continents:
Brazil: Protest by educators for better wages
Brazilian blogger Rosangela Basso posts several photos and videos of the most recent protest by educators that took place on August 9 in the city of Rio de Janeiro.
Chile: Live broadcast of the March for Education Reform of 18 August
Today's march for education reform can be followed by live broadcast via Citizen Intelligent and Common Sense.
On Twitter, netizens are using the hashtags #18deagosto, #marchadelosparaguas, #marchaestudiental, and others to tweet about the protest.
Chile: New alliance between Global Voices and My Voice
Global Voices and Mi Voz - a Chilean electronic citizen's daily network - have just launched a content alliance.
Global Voices will publish a monthly article with stories from Mi Voz, amplifying the voices of its citizen correspondents to an international audience.
For its part, Mi Voz will publish an article prepared by Global Voices with content previously agreed upon by the editors of both organizations.
In addition, both will share content freely, according to a Creative Commons policy.
Global Voices readers already know a little bit about the work of My Voice thanks to articles written by Katie Manning, reporter for My Voice and the first contact to start conversations and make this alliance possible.
Katie will continue to share content from My Voice in English for Global Voices.
With this alliance Global Voices will enrich its coverage of Chilean news from a hyperlocal citizen perspective focused on news outside the capital, Santiago.
My Voice has more than 10,000 citizen journalists writing for its 18 media outlets from 14 regions across the country.
Founded in 2005, Mi Voz explains that its inspiration "is to generate media spaces, which enable society to actively engage in dialogue, creation and action, of aspects that are significant to the local community".
My Voice announced this alliance on Paradiary 14.
Puerto Rico: Tropical Storm Irene leaves damage and heavy rainfall
Tropical Storm Irene made landfall in Puerto Rico on August 21 leaving strong winds, floods, rain and the evacuation of entire communities.
Indymedia notes that poor black women were the most affected by the weather phenomenon:
The communities most likely to be affected by flooding are the coastal towns with the largest population of black families.
Today we saw that with a storm the country collapses.
Of course, amidst all this, the digital humor magazine El Ñame couldn't help but launch a puja against the notorious electrical malfunction after the storms shook the country.
Bolivia: Aymara women working as 'vocers' in El Alto
Alberto Medrano shares two videos of Aymara women in El Alto working in minibuses as voicers: women announcing the route of the vehicle and charging the passengers for the ticket.
Cristina Quisbert blogged about these women in 2008 in Indigenous Bolivia.
Regarding the opinions on the number of immigrants in Spain (according to official figures, 5,056,256 as of March), the NeoBandam page recalls that:
Already in 2010, the Madrid-based Movement Against Intolerance warned of the links between the economic crisis and the rise of xenophobia in the country.
The news that came out in August about PxC is not exhausted in this attempt to protest against what they consider to be the benefits of immigrants, especially Muslims, in Catalonia.
PxC is not opposed to immigration, but it is opposed to the establishment of Muslim immigrants in our country, a phenomenon that can pose a clear threat to our culture in the long run.
But, in all this context, it is interesting to consider what the blog Inmigrantes in Spain calls an operation to erase racist allegations and criminal proceedings in Spain, which manifests itself in the absence of public debate on the subject:
Singapore elects a new president
Dr. Tony Tan was elected the seventh president of Singapore on August 27, but his margin of victory was only 7,269 votes.
However, under our simple majority system, the elections have produced a clear winner, who has the mandate to be the next President.
AKIKONOMU explains why the presidency is basically a ceremonial post:
The political landscape has changed, according to Yee Jenn Yong:
Iran: New demonstrations to save Lake Urmia
Once again thousands of protesters have filled the streets of Tabriz and Urmia, in the Azerbaijan region of Iran, to call on the Iranian government to save the dying Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest saltwater lakes.

The reports were censored in the Iranian-based media, but several videos were posted online on YouTube and bloggers flooded the blogosphere with notes on the subject.
Blogger Urmuiscierli writes that there have been clashes on the streets with security forces beating and arresting protesters and even tying them to trees.
Some bloggers have called for more Iranians to support Azerbaijani activists and re-launch demonstrations in the country.
The construction of a dam in part of the lake, in addition to the recent drought, has significantly reduced the amount of water Urmia receives.
This has increased salinity, removed many birds and caused permanent damage to the ecosystem.
If the lake dries up, millions of people in the region will need to move elsewhere to survive.
Protests in Urmia
1freecountry writes that Lake Urmia does not distinguish between Tehran and Tabriz, that we should organize everywhere over the next few weeks.
Mosbate1000 says that:
We should be aware that the Revolutionary Guards have a cyber-armed force; sometimes they publish and share contacts intended to divide Iranians.
Doughodushab calls on the Iranians to defend Lake Urmia and Azerbaijan.
The blogger says we are all trapped by the Islamic regime and that we should protect our natural and cultural heritage.
Venezuela: Problems with accessing Blogger.com
Throughout August, Venezuelan bloggers have been complaining about the difficulties of accessing Blogger.com services. A discussion has opened up in Google support forums, according to which, the access routes made by users are giving different types of response, the most common being "Destination host unreachable".
According to users, the problems are intermittent and are preventing them from entering their own desks and blogs.
In addition, they have said that it is possible to access Blogger using Google's alternative DNS when the problem arises.
However, the problem had never lasted this long and had not caught the attention of the mass media.
A few days ago, one of Venezuela's leading newspapers, Last News, reported:

There's always something to learn from Shakespeare, and if I can encourage these young people to master these texts at an early age, they could get as far as they want.
This is one of the reasons I do this.
I teach in some schools in the city and the response has been good.
Merchant from Venice?
Their initiative is based on the desire to contribute to creating not only a culture of reading among school-going children, but also to actually open their eyes to other career opportunities.
"I think if you take it seriously, you can become professional actors as the theater is gaining popularity across the country", says Chaka.

Peru: The state of Quechua on the Internet
Quechua, or Runa Simi, is one of the languages originating in Peru, speculating that it may have originated in the middle of the first millennium of our era.
Currently, it is spoken by between 8 and 10 million people and is the most widespread linguistic family in Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador after Indo-European.1
Peruvians use more Quechua words than we think.
India: Outrage at bomb blast in front of Delhi Supreme Court
At least nine people were reported dead and more than 45 injured in an explosion outside the Delhi Supreme Court on the morning of Wednesday, September 7.

I'm so sorry about that.
This time in the Supreme Court itself.
Lebanon: Empowering migrant workers in languages
A community of young Beirut enthusiasts, the Migrant Workers Force, are working to support foreign domestic workers in Lebanon, whose lives and working conditions are often fairly unfair.
The volunteer group has been active only since January 2011 but has already managed to attract the attention of both the local and international press for its innovative approach to changing the perceptions of workers and employers.
Among its main achievements are the free language courses offered every Sunday to workers to learn Arabic, English or French.
Eighty percent of migrant domestic workers cannot leave their employer's home.
Their status and rights are almost universally ignored.
Initially, the Workers' Force consisted of only Alex, Lioba, Farah, Ali and Janie and a few other members, but recently the group has expanded.
According to Janie Shen, 24, one of the group's co-founders (the only foreign woman still in Lebanon), the idea of the Migrant Workers Force was born after newcomers like her and Alex were surprised by the conditions of migrant workers in the country - for example, degrading uniforms, general abuse, having their passports confiscated, rationed food and only one or no day off a week.
In this video Janie explains something more about what the Migrant Workers Force is:
The Migrant Workers Force has no official office or organization but meets regularly at the Zico house in Hamra and will soon re-establish itself, for some of its activities, at the Migrant House in Nabaa.
'Go to a poor man, but he is a source of well-being.'
Among his best campaigns are his anti-racism poster for International Labour Day (with the collaboration of three language class students), a series of interviews with migrants about their conditions and some satirical short films in response to an official campaign showing Lebanon as a haven for tourists.
They have also organized celebrations with local migrants, such as the Nepalese New Year celebration and helped sell food from Africa and Asia as well as products from other migrant countries.
Language classes
On Sundays, workers from Nepal, the Philippines, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Sudan, gather to learn languages with volunteer teachers who want to help them.
They started out as informal meetings but are now organized into more structured language classes.
One professor says, "I offer my English skills to allow you to talk about your rights".
Language classes have become an important place for community building.
In less than two years the Migrant Workers' Force has mobilized more volunteers and the goodwill of many other more established organizations.
Through language and communication, they have helped migrant domestic workers in Lebanon who face a very local problem to gain much deserved international attention.
Iran: Blogger receives 50 lashes

Tunisia: Police beat up blogger for telling a joke
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Tunisian Uprising.
Eight months after the fall of the Ben Ali regime, the Tunisian police have not given up on brutality and human rights violations.
On Wednesday, Tunisian blogger Azyz Amamy (@Azyyoz), was arrested and beaten by police for telling a banana joke near the police station.
He was released the same day.
In fact, last week, Interim Prime Minister Beji Caid Sebsi addressed the nation.
During his speech, he said that "97 percent of the National Guard agents are good, the rest are monkeys".

This could explain why the police reacted so brutally to Amamy's joke.

Virtual activism reports:
The following is a list of the most important bloggers:
After the interview with Yaya Coulibaly, Rising Voices wants to introduce Oumar Dembelé, a primary school teacher in Zambougou, in the city of Cinzana-Gare, which is in the Ségou region of Mali.
In addition, Oumar participates in Ségou Villages Connection, one of the projects that VR supports and which was started in 2011.
As a teacher, Oumar has the advantage of being accustomed to communicating with students and their families and, when communicating with other people, in this case with villagers, he uses those communication skills.
Oumar collects the stories of these people and sends them by SMS to Boukary Konaté, the project director, who then publishes them on the blog Ségou Infos.
As for his activities, in addition to working and training in the technology area, Oumar likes to practice sports and reading.
In this interview, conducted by email, Oumar, who tweets as @D1Oumar tells us about his feelings, the journey he is undertaking with this project and the positive impact that the training courses are having.
Rising Voices: Tell us about your involvement in the Ségou Village Project.
Why did you join him and what is your mission within the project?
Oumar Dembélé - Representative of the village of Ségou in Zambougo
Oumar Dembélé: I joined the team thanks to Mr. Boukary Konaté (@Fasokan), whom I met while traveling in Cinzana-Gare.
He suggested that I participate in this project, which involves sending information via SMS; then we continued with the course we were doing on the Internet in the city of Dioro.
I found the project interesting because I realized that people didn't really talk much about what was happening in rural areas.
RV: How do you get the information together?
Do people cooperate when it comes to sharing information?
OD: For now, making contact with people is not a problem for me, because as an educator, I know how to approach people.
RV: You are a teacher.
Do you think the courses you have received can help you in your profession and to what extent?
Do you think that your colleagues and students can also benefit from your new knowledge?
OD: Obviously, I ask myself the same question often.
RV: The Segou Infos blog emerged due to the lack of contact or communication that existed in Mali, especially between cities (especially in the capital, Bamako) and rural communities of the country.
The aim of this project is to connect the rural world to the present and to achieve equal consideration at all levels.
If all participants perform their work 100%, Ségou Infos will achieve much greater diffusion.
RV: Could you describe what life is like in the Ségou region?
OD: Ségou is a historic city that has great heroes like Binton Coulibali, NGolo Diarra, Da Monzon Diarra, etc. The population is made up of the Bambara, De Bozo, Sarakolé, Peulh and other ethnic groups.
The activities under way are agriculture, livestock, fisheries and trade; agriculture is undoubtedly the most important and developed of them all.
Market of the Ségou Région region - Image from the Blog Ségou Infos.
RV: Would you like to add something more for Rising Voices readers around the world?
OD: First of all, I want to send a greeting to Boukary Konaté, who suggested that I join this initiative.
I also invite Global Voices readers to visit Ségou to learn and learn about things that are not often talked about.
Thank you all. Thank you.

Cameroon: What if we don't vote on October 9?
The presidential elections on October 9 in Cameroon, seem to generate little interest in people.
Although his candidacy for re-election has not been a surprise, it has caused quite a stir in public opinion.
This opinion is supported by the fact that among the 21 candidates selected by the Electoral Council, none of them actually stands out, as this blogger expresses:
Arab bloggers gather in Tunisia
On Monday 3 October, the Third Meeting of Arab Bloggers began in Tunisia, with a one-day public conference.
The meeting is co-organized by Global Voices, Nawaat and the Heinrich Böll Foundation and attended by about 100 bloggers from almost all Arab countries.
Naturally, the conference was well-blogged, not only on the official blog of Arab Bloggers, but also by many participants.
Here are links to media and blog coverage (please tell us what we have left out in the comments section).
A news story on Al Jazeera about the meeting proclaimed: "Arab bloggers say the Arab Spring has become global".
The English-language blog coverage included Jillian York's posts on Day 1, Part 1 and a special panel that included Tunisian bloggers who are now involved in Tunisian politics in many ways.
The main news came from an innovative talk by the new president of the Tunisian Internet Agency, where he revealed that Tunisia secretly tested censorship software for Western companies.

Photo by Mohamed Alâa Guedich (used with permission) The meeting continues in smaller workshops, for guests only, which will be held over the next three days.
Participants continue to tweet about topics to be discussed in many languages using the #AB11 tag, and the conference blog will continue to post updates.
So be careful.
Many bloggers believe that the Second Meeting of Arab Bloggers, held in Beirut in 2009, played an important role in building personal ties and trust among bloggers across the region - links that allowed them to coordinate more easily during the Arab Spring.
Myanmar: President suspends dam project
The construction of the controversial dam project on the Ayeyarwaddy River, located in the northern part of Myanmar, has been suspended by the government.
President Thein Sein sent a letter to Parliament informing them that the dam project will be postponed for the sake of public interest.
The project is one of China's infrastructure investments in Myanmar.
The plan was to export the energy generated at this plant to China.
Last month, Minister of Electrical Energy Zaw Min told reporters that the government would not suspend the project despite concerns expressed by some groups.
But public activities, such as signing a petition, community workshops and seminars demanding the government stop construction of the dam have intensified in recent weeks.
Even media organizations echoed the public, including well-known personalities, who asked the president to cancel the project.

Zambia: Cyber users start counting down the promise of change in 90 days
In the last three elections he has taken part in, Zambia's new president, Michael Sata, promised to transform the country in 90 days, including the promise to put more money in people's pockets.
Now that he's finally elected head of state, prospective netizens have begun the countdown.
Some of Sata's Facebook followers are convinced that the countdown has started on a positive note, while others say that expecting any significant transformation in 90 days is unrealistic.
In other news, a group called '90 Day Agenda' has started a Facebook page to press.
Zambians are trying to catch a glimpse of the new president at the September 2011 inauguration ceremony.

Sunday, October 16, is election day in Bolivia.
However, this choice is different from the previous ones.
The candidates were banned from public campaigning and had to rely on limited media interviews and advertisements recorded by the Plurinacional Electoral Organ.
What's also different about this election is that it won't determine a President, members of Congress or local mayors.
For the first time in Bolivia, as well as in Latin America, voters will elect 56 judges and magistrates of the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, the Judiciary Council and the Agricultural/Environmental Court.
These elections have been guaranteed by the new Constitution with the idea of eliminating the direct nomination of judges by the political party holding a majority in the Congress, as was previously done.
Some of those feelings come from a statement by Bolivian President Evo Morales, in August 2011 at an event in Tolata, who said "I am sure sisters and brothers in this election of the Judicial Body again we will win with 60, 70 percent with 90, 100 percent in the peasant communities".
There have been some reports of irregularities in the selection process, as well as the questioning of the impartiality of the President of the Supreme Electoral Court, Wilfredo Ovando, who was found to have strong ties to the MAS in his recent campaign during the reelection of Morales.
Twitter user Gastón (@gastulas), is skeptical about the independence of the candidates and tweets:

It comes after a month of marches by indigenous movements against the planned highway and who arrived in La Paz two days ago".

Here are some of the reactions on Twitter, via the #tnelec tag, on election night:
Russia: They explain the success of the National Free Struggle System
Russian fighters are usually considered the best in the world.
Mr Karelin was a Russian fighter and elite Olympian and is now an elected official working in the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Russian State Duma.
Vladimir Anoshenko was a Belarusian national champion, and also a wrestling coach at an American university.
In a blog post last year he addressed the issue of why the Russian team is so effective:
Languages: Tweet and talk in Quechua
Imagine that you have always wanted to learn Quechua, an indigenous language spoken in the Andean region of South America, but you have never had time to attend classes properly.
Now, a new project called Let's Talk Quechua has developed a way to offer daily lessons through a series of automated tweets that help the interested learner form a vocabulary.
The team includes Kiko Mayorga, developer Mariano Crowe and Irma Álvarez Ccoscco, a Quechua poet and translator for the Runasimipi organization.
The result of this collaboration is the Twitter account (@hablemosquechua), which currently has nearly 1700 followers.
The program is created from a database of Spanish words and their Quechua equivalents to provide pairs of terms:
She also tweets small questions asking followers to recall previous lessons:
The Quechua language has numerous dialects and varies from region to region, producing variations in lexicon and spelling.
This is something the project has fully acknowledged, and they apologize for choosing Quechua spoken in the Cusco-Collao region of Peru as the dialect for the program.
This is the main reason why tweets use the expression "the Quechua word for" flower "may be" t'ika, "a way of recognizing that there might be other words for flower.
They hope to be able to account for these differences between regional dialects, as well as make the account much more interactive and responsive to the replicas of their followers.
The program could also be used by other language communities who would like to use Twitter as a way to provide short, quick vocabulary lessons to underrepresented language learners.

Global Voices Podcast: Reducing the language gap
This post is part of our special coverage on Languages and the Internet.
Hello world!
In this edition of Global Voices Podcast we discussed languages that are difficult to find on the Internet.
Do you speak a language that's hard to find on the Internet?
Do you live somewhere where your mother tongue is not widely spoken?
So you're part of a large number of people in the world who speak and write "under-represented languages".
We also look forward to the 11 Eleven project on 11/11/11.
New dialogue for the preservation of languages on the Internet
The good news is that here at Global Voices, we are looking for new ways for people to use citizen media to strengthen and enjoy indigenous and under-represented languages.
Eddie Avila is the director of the Global Voices project, Rising Voices.
He told me how he came to explore this topic and how he's working with New Tactics for Human Rights and others to continue the discussion.
In our interview, Eddie mentions the amazing work of Kevin Scannell.
Kevin is a professor of mathematics and computer science at St. Louis University.
He told us how he got into the field of mapping indigenous tweets and micro-blogs around the world.
Using phones to solve the language challenge in India
Using a mobile phone to access the web in a language that is underrepresented is not yet easy.
But the Internet is full of people willing to take on those challenges to make our digital world a more inclusive place.
One of our Global Voices authors Aparna Ray guided me to Shubhranshu Choudhary who works at CG Net Swara, a mobile-based community radio station in India.
He explained how this service helps people who communicate in the least represented languages.
A podcast in Quechua
There are many really interesting initiatives on the Internet that can help us explore underrepresented languages online.
Christine Mladic is the program manager at the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies at New York University and participates in a series of podcasts called Rimasun that seek to highlight and make use of the Quechua language.
A day to remember
As this is the November edition of Global Voices' podcast, it means we're close to the date, 11/11/11.
This is a special day for those who are participating in the 11 Eleven project.
Danielle Lauren is the creative director and she explained to us what's going on and how we can all participate.
Some of the people Danielle mentions are Global Voices authors, and ambassadors for the Eleven Eleven project, so I asked Salman Latif from Pakistan and Lalatiana Rahariniaina from Madagascar to share their expectations for that day.
We're also in...
That's all we could cover this time on the podcast.
But there's good news!

The Flood Disaster in Thailand
Below is a map of the flooded areas of Bangkok:
These days Buddhist monks have gone out to fight the advance of the floods.
The water seems to be confined to the main street, and so far the flow does not seem to be so large as to advance much further over the city; but, once this is clarified, it can be observed that some of the smaller adjoining streets have become completely underwater.
Twitter user @ThanongK criticizes the government's efforts to mitigate the situation: @ThanongK: Only middle-class people with internet access get information about floods.
The common people don't know what's going on.

Tunisia: Police violently dispersed anti-capitalism protesters
This article is part of the special coverage of the 2010/11 Tunisian uprising.
Inspired by the Occupy movements taking place around the world, mainly Occupy Wall Street, and under the umbrella of the global Occupy the World event on 11.11.11, hundreds of protesters took to the streets towards #occupytunis showing their anti-capitalism slogans.
#OccupyTunis took place on the Human Rights Square, an avenue in the center of the capital crowded with financial institutions and banks.
The following YouTube video shows protesters marching through the center of Tunisia before arriving at the plaza where they would later meet, as they chant "people want me to end the debt", alluding to Tunisia's debts, "people want Wall Street to fall" and "employment, freedom and not debt".

China: Photo captures the situation of 58 million 'left-behind children'
A photo of a little girl carrying her baby brother in a classroom caused a sensation in Chinese cyberspace last month.
This reflects the age-old social problem of children who are 'left behind' in rural villages by their parents.
The discussion has been "harmonized" on online platforms under the term "My little brother wants to sleep" (弟弟要睡了) which has been leaked and is now unfounded in major search engines like Sina, Baidu and Sohu since November 7, 2011 as the discussion was becoming increasingly political.
It is estimated that there are about 58 million abandoned children in China.
My little brother wants to sleep.
The 10-year-old girl in the photo is named Long Zhanghuang, her two-year-old brother is named Zhang Junjie.
Her parents are migrant rural workers who work in the city while her children live with their grandparents.
The classroom is located in a village in Fenghuang County, Hunan Province.

Cuba: "bloggers" debate about Internet "Offline" on Radio Martí
On September 22, 2011, the host of Radio Martí, Karen Caballero, presided over a debate between blogger and anthropologist from the University of the City of New York (CUNY) Ted Henken and several Cuban "bloggers", including Yoani Sánchez, Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo and several Henken students.
This was a special event for Radio Martí.
This radio and television network is funded and overseen by the Broadcasting Board of Governors, the U.S. federal agency responsible for directing radio and television broadcasts in countries where government-independent media are scarce or heavily censored.
Most of Radio Martí's programming is clearly anti-Castro and supports U.S. policy in Cuba; most of its audience considers it a symbol of the political stalemate that the U.S. and Cuba have suffered for decades.
But this particular program focused on a group of Cubans: "bloggers", who do not define themselves as either dissidents or defenders of the fall of the Cuban government.
Participants discussed the increasing visibility of "bloggers" and social media in Cuba, and the particular way these new media are used on the island, where the penetration rate of the Internet and mobile phones is extremely low.
Orlando Luis Pardo Lazo, a photographer for the blog Boring Home Utopics, described the Internet "offline" as something that had been formed by the Cuban media:
This is the Internet offline , the Internet without the Internet ... blogs circulate through internal Cuban emails ... blogs circulate offline discs, on CDs, flash memory, DVDs, and, therefore, information is passed from one hand to another ...
Sanchez described his Blogger Academy  as a place where he teaches friends and acquaintances how to use the tools of recent media as they are really new to most Cubans.
She described: Get the most out of your mobile , as a workshop where she teaches participants how to "post" photos, videos and "tweets" via SMS.
I preferred the neighbor next door... but the Internet was not a decision.
The Internet was the only option.
We came to the conclusion that we would never be given a minute on the radio, a minute on television, not even a line in the national press.
So we had to use the Internet as the only civic expression.
Of course, the Internet is far from being a "perfect" way of expressing and sharing information.
For many Cubans, the Internet is still an unknown place and the simple concept of a blog or Twitter account is difficult for them to understand.
But for Cubans who can access the Internet or who participate in the Internet "offline" blogs and social networks have opened up a space for communication and expression completely independent of the government.
This is novel and very powerful, and while its social effects may be small and gradual, some "bloggers" believe that things are beginning to change thanks to technology on the island.
The Cuban poet and sculptor Antonio José Ponte, who also participated in the conversation, held this idea.
As information becomes more visible, people are now much less afraid to be informed.
All that fear is being relegated to new methods of communication.
* While this radio program allowed listeners to learn more about the particular stance of the new media in Cuba, the broadcast represented a rare encounter with the general media landscape in Cuba.
The second post will feature an interview with Ted Henken, who will tell us about his experience working with Radio Martí, a US government-funded broadcaster.

Zambia: Porn video fuels debate about gender, culture and morals
Recently a video of a young student at one of Zambia's most expensive schools, the Zambian Accounting Center (ZCAS), having sex with her boyfriend came to light on a hardcore porn site (we didn't publish the link or name) and went viral among Zambian internet users who freely shared the link.
Zambia is a culturally conservative Christian nation where such a video is considered immoral and also illegal under chapter 87 of the Zambia Penal Code Act, which considers it a crime to create or distribute obscene material.
Offenders can face up to five years in prison if found guilty.
The comments, which add up to hundreds and even thousands if you count those appearing on different online platforms, are varied.
@lwangamwilu I really think it's unfair for society to treat her like this, where are the women's groups: WfC (Women for Change, an open NGO advocating for gender)?
If you've never filmed yourself with your girlfriend, I imagine you're still living in the '20s when it was hard to find a camera.
Don't make this look more than it is.
They're not "actors" and no money was exchanged.

Iran: British embassy attacked in Tehran
British Embassy
On November 29, a crowd of about a thousand people demonstrated near the British embassy in Tehran after Britain cut all financial ties with Iran over doubts about its nuclear program.
The meeting was peaceful, before some protesters stormed the building.
This incident reminded many observers of the 1979 attack on the US embassy in Tehran.
A few days earlier, Iran's parliament voted to expel the British ambassador as relations have deteriorated.
Here's a video of the demonstration:

January: Extra, extra, read it all!
As a culmination of a seven-week program in which young residents of the Brazilian municipality of Januária learned to ask questions about how local government operates in the city, as well as reflect these questions in blog posts, citizen journalists from the Rising Voices Friends of Januária-funded project recently published a special edition newspaper titled "Folha do Norte".
This paper complements the ongoing work of citizen journalists, who have been publishing a series of reports that analyze local problems affecting all residents.
In addition to publishing articles online, the newspaper, both in electronic and print formats, gives them the opportunity to reach those inhabitants who do not have internet access.The newspaper, free and available at various points in Januária municipality, provides articles that report on local problems, from healthcare to infrastructure and education projects, as well as the role of culture in the place.
Download the paper here:
In the course of the next few weeks we will translate some excerpts from articles published in the "Folha do Norte" into English.
Peru: Cybermen denounce police crackdown during protests in Lima against miner Conga
Several Peruvian internet users denounced police repression during a protest held on December 5 in Lima, against the Conga mining project in Cajamarca.

Venezuela: Wave of expropriations on Twitter
For months, social media in Venezuela and traditional media have denounced a wave of expropriations made to Twitter accounts of open critics of the government.
From time to time, followers of these accounts were surprised to see that many of the figures who spoke out against the government published messages of unconditional support for the Bolivarian Revolution, or confessed to being followers and admirers of President Hugo Chávez.
The wave of identity usurpations, or "hackers" as they have been called, has reached the accounts of artists, politicians, journalists, writers and academics who openly criticize government movements.
Two months ago, N33 Group issued a statement (available in Taringa) and assumed responsibility for online expropriations made during that period.
Apparently not, because N33 considers them a "pro-imperialist" group and what they seek is to do justice to the Twitter attacks on President Chávez and his government
Just in my Bello Pais! #venezuela good for Luis! @laureanomar: To inform you that @luisvicenteleon hacked the hacker and recovered your account...
Finally, Luis Carlos Díaz, in his post The Hacker's Bill, comments and reflects:
As a result, crime is on the rise and official silence continues.
Do you remember that?
Egypt: Remembering Khaled Said for a "World Without Torture"
Recently, the International Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Torture (IRCT) released a 15-minute film titled World Without Torture that focuses on the importance of avoiding torture and also the importance of documenting it and providing rehabilitation to torture survivors.
Elizabeth Rivera, author and translator for Global Voices
Elizabeth Rivera arrived this year and has been translating for Global Voices in Spanish ever since, writing her own articles for both GlobalVoices in Spanish and Global Voices Online and also translating for Global Voices in English.
The end result is this little interview I'm sharing with you today.
Hi Elizabeth, tell us about yourself, where are you from, where are you, what are you doing?
- Hey, you!
I'm a citizen of the world who by chance and fortune was born in Mexico D.F. a little over 30 years ago.
I've lived in six cities in three countries and I hope to have the fortune to increase that number.
Today I am in Santiago, Chile and every day - in addition to collaborating with Global Voices - I earn my living as a marketing expert.
How did you learn about Global Voices and get involved in their work?
With the birth of the Arab Spring, I reactivated my Twitter account.
I started following interesting people who posted regularly, including @JustAmira.
I was struck by the Twitbon that was on his profile and that's how I got to Global Voices.
I immediately fell in love with the site when I read the posts there and why they were there, and I saw the link to collaborate as a translator and I said, "Here I am".
You contacted me the same day and the rest is history.
Now I not only translate but I have the opportunity to write my own pieces.
I am very proud to be part of this community and I hope to continue to be a part of it for a long time.
I've learned a lot and met some very valuable people.
Elizabeth Rivera with her little daughter.
2011 is the year.
How do you make time for translating and writing?
A little discipline is all.
When I take a translation, I set a deadline or time to deliver it.
When I'm writing a post, I don't take translations.
Anyway, I type fast on the keyboard and I'm used to doing a lot of things at the same time (you know, work, being a mom, husband, writing, friends, etc, etc.):)
You said you've lived in six different cities, tell us about your travels!
Now that I remember it, it's seven!
In Mexico I have lived in D.F., Cuernavaca, San Cristóbal de las Casas and Cancun.
In the United States, I lived in Irvine and Chino, both cities in California.
In Chile, only in Santiago.
Mexico D.F. is the city where I was born and where I have my roots, my people, my identity.
It is a community, in the middle of the Zapatista zone, very poor in material terms, but tremendously rich in culture.
It's been one of the most rewarding and profound experiences I've ever had in my life.
Elizabeth Rivera in Dublin, Ireland. She was born in Dublin, Ireland.
Changing topics, how do you see the Chilean student movement?
The Chilean student movement of 2011 is the second part of the "penguin revolution" of 2006.
Education is the foundation of any society.
It's not just a problem of the universities, it's about "going in and picking" from kindergarten.
I think that if Chile wants to continue to grow and aspires to be a developed and inclusive nation, it must have an education system that accompanies these goals.
This must be what prevails at the tables.
The youth have already lit the flame of change, now it is up to the current government to seize the golden opportunity it has in front of it to leave a positive mark on Chile's history.
And what do you think is the reason the government doesn't want to give in to the core of its education model?
Both personal and ideological.
Others are "scared" of getting their hands on tax laws or think that reform would be too complicated and/or expensive.
The status quo is easier and more comfortable.
Finally, at least this time, the protests have managed to bring the discussion to deeper issues and have not lost the pressure level, which is already a gain from the previous movement.
How do you assess the use and impact of new media in the student movement?
New media have been key to elevating the discussion and including all citizens at this table.
Anyone can have an opinion, debate, propose.
That's always good for a democracy.
Even at the beginning of this movement, they didn't even cover the protests by giving news of anything while thousands of people were on the streets protesting.
Elizabeth Rivera in Angelmó, Puerto Montt, Chile, in the year 2010.
Why are you volunteering at Global Voices and not at another NGO?
For me, connectivity in every way is important.
It was the reason I chose my career and that's why I like to travel.
Global Voices has allowed me and allows readers to understand cultures, ways of thinking and news from other perspectives, which is extremely enriching by making the bonds narrow and the borders - starting with the language - disappear.
It's normal for my husband, my daughter and I to pack a suitcase on a Friday and come back on Sunday without any major problems.
I also like to read, mostly historical novels, although since my little girl was born I haven't had much time to devote to reading.
I like to play with her and show her new things, see how she learns.
And to show you how true it is that you can come, our regional editor Silvia Viñas, took a leap to find her and they chatted briefly, which is what I remember from this little video:
And keep following Elizabeth on Twitter: @elimaguire.

Ukraine: Public hospital pioneer in social media use
Founded in 1798, the Dniopropetrovsk Regional Hospital  named after Ilya Ilych Mechnikov- is one of the oldest hospitals in Ukraine.
It is also one of the first medical institutions to use social media.
The person behind the creation of the Twitter (@MechnikovaBoln) and Facebook accounts of the country's first public hospital, is the knowledgeable epidemiologist and blogger Mykhailo Sukholym (@mvsnotes, mvsnotes.blogspot.com).
However, this is not the first time a social media account has been created for a state medical institution.
Social media enthusiasts
Sukhomlyn and his wife  the programmer Tetyana Cheshko (@tvnotes) - used to work in the state's health epidemiology department.
Both are social media fans, and they created the institution's Twitter account, which was initially used only for internal information exchange between department staff.
Mykhailo and Tetyana confirmed that, frequently, Twitter users contacted them with questions about health and medicine.
After becoming head of the information office at the Dnipropetrovsk Regional Hospital, Sukhomlyn decided to take advantage of her successful experience there and launched social media accounts to share news about the hospital, including events, vacancies, the arrival of new teams, etc.

In an interview with Channel 9 Dnipropetrovsk TV, Sukhomlyn said the hospital's Twitter account is used to publicize the services provided by the institution, while Facebook users are encouraged to use this platform to discuss the quality of the services.
For example, one of the first problems patients encountered was the long lines in the hospital.
Other medical staff at the institution are also using Twitter.
Last month, the hospital shared its list of followers to encourage others to repeat the action:
Slovakia: The most expensive Apple computers
The University of Economics in Bratislava (EUBA) has just signed a contract to acquire electronic systems and software for its National Economy School at a price of 1.8 million euros.
Many of these products are overpriced (you can see the contract here).
For example, a MacBook would cost the university about 9000 euros even though it's not a final model (to be more precise, the price of "9000 euros for a MacBook" also includes a 24-inch Apple LCD screen, an external keyboard and a mouse).
However, normally the sum total would be about 3000 euros, plus an extended service contract.
According to the media, the university does not think there is any anomaly and explains that prices are the result of a public competition, which is won by the lowest bidder.
The winning supplier, Gratex International, stated that there were products that did not bring profits so they decided that it was other products that would bring them.
The opposite!

Chile: Neighbors and Internet users unite to save the Concon Dunes
Since the company Reñaca Concón S.A. started the efforts to build a real estate complex in the delicate and unique ecosystem of the Dunes of Concón, the struggle of the neighbors to prevent development began.
On December 27, 2011, their nightmare was fulfilled: the construction company began erecting a fence around the protected area.
But this time they were not alone, Chilean cyberspace was filled with protests against this closure and the construction of up to 20 luxury department buildings in the sector thus accompanying the claims of the 50 neighbors who demonstrated at the site.
The tweeter @Perro_del_Lucho warned:
The world speaks... we translate
End of year is usually a time when evaluations are made of what has been done during the year that is about to end.
Sometimes it is aimed at being very objective and others the subjectivities of those who do it float, however most of the time, these balances, counts and lists of the best of the year do not satisfy everyone.
On Global Voices in Spanish, some members of the translators' team who spent those twelve months behind the scenes to bring you the best of what Global Voices Online publishes daily, were imbued with this spirit and decided to express briefly about what they liked most about translating or what impacted them most about what we saw published.
And as they say in my land, let's leave the flower and go to the grain:
Gabriela García Calderón tells us how she unknowingly put her sand grain into the spread of a movement of then unknown consequences:
Podcast by Global Voices: 2012, happy new year
All links are in English except those specified in another language
In this podcast, we will review 2011; we will see the differences and similarities between mainstream news and new journalism and we will also talk about a Rising Voices meeting in Bolivia to support the development of an ethnically and socially diverse blogosphere.
And we'll go on a road trip over the internet on two wheels!
Balance sheet for 2011
For journalists, bloggers and commentators around the world, 2011 has been an unusual year.
It is difficult to imagine a time in the past when our friends and colleagues were threatened, arrested or abused on such a scale.
There was also not a year when we saw so much influence from the citizen media on the Internet.
For many of our writers and friends at Global Voices, times are still tough, but let us have faith that better times will come.
Looking back, the year of Global Voices has been a feat.
Our associate editor, Emma Brewin, talks about jumping into the hectic tidal wave of global news and about the stories that most impacted her this hectic year.
From mainstream information to new media
Global Voices' regional teams are made up of writers, bloggers and editors of many classes.
Some, such as Thiana Bondo, Global Voices author and translator from Bahia, Brazil, come from journalism.
Our editor-in-chief, Solana Larsen, spoke to Thiana, who is currently in London, about the differences between being a newspaper correspondent in Brazil and writing for Global Voices.
In support of indigenous websites in Bolivia
In December, Rising Voices hosted a three-day event in Cochabamba (Bolivia) for Bolivian bloggers.
The aim was to support the development of a more weighty and diverse blogosphere.
There were workshops and presentations of technical tools and organizational strategies.
The meeting was in Spanish and was called Connecting Us.
Maria Mercado is a student and volunteer who works with indigenous communities.
He attended the meeting and tells us what he learned.
If you want to hear more, there's a fantastic podcast covering the entire Rising Voices meeting, created by our CEO Georgia Poppellwell and Rising Voices director Eduardo Avila.
Come on your bike with us!
You may think that distance separates us and only the Internet unites us, but apparently we also have some healthy habits in common.
Always prepared with her recorder, Solana Larsen talks about the wonders of riding a bike with Global Voices CEO Ivan Sigal.
As Ivan says, the online cycling community is amazing.
Naturally, I was forced to ask our bicycle and audio geniuses to share their ideas about the two wheels with us.
Cyrus Farivar, an American journalist currently living in Germany and author of "The Internet of Elsewhere", spoke to us about cycling - directly from the seat of his bicycle.
In Denmark, Maria Grabowski Kjaer shared the sounds of the city where cycling is a party.
Anyway, that's all we got on our first podcast of the year.
We'll be here for 2012, introducing and talking about the world's customs and news, so get in touch and above all decide what you'd like to hear.
I'll leave you for now, inspired by our two-wheeled stars, I'll see if I can learn to ride my bike without being a danger to myself and to those around me!

Singing the national anthem in their own language
If you watched the 2011 Rugby World Cup, you may have noticed some of the players from the host country, New Zealand, and their fans, singing their national anthem in two languages. It wasn't until 1999, in a match against England, that one of the two official national anthems, "God Defends New Zealand", was introduced in a new format with the first stanza sung in Māori and the second stanza in English.
Both are the official languages of New Zealand, but English is the most widely spoken and understood.
Still, the history of the Māori language dates back to at least the 13th century, long before the arrival of the settlers.
However, New Zealand's passion for the sport of rugby, of which it is the current world champion, has led many more citizens to have an active interest in learning the lyrics of the anthem.
Video of a 2005 game:
According to Ashley Mackenzie-White of the Ministry of Culture and Heritage, thousands have been visiting the ministry's website to listen to or study the words of the bilingual anthem.
Karaitiana Taiuru, Māori language and technology activist, provides the lyrics of the anthem on her blog:

Will Iran soon have its "clean internet"?
The Iranian regime may be losing its battle to filter content on the internet, but in the meantime it is trying new things - from slowing down the network, to developing a supposed "national internet" or "clean internet" (read Intranet).
Iranian members of parliament have also discussed a proposal to place blogs, comments and SMS messages under the same government regulation as mass media.
Iranian authorities see the internet as a real battlefield and view citizen media and social media as tools for a "soft war".
For several years they have claimed to have blocked and leaked millions of websites and blogs.
Now several bloggers have reported that Corporate Computing Systems of Iran says the goal for Iran is to be completely cut off from the world wide web once the country launches its own national internet.
Mehdi Jafari thanks to The Green Voice of Freedom
In October, many bloggers were happy to quote the statements of a senior official who said, "Filtering is useless".
Mehdi Jafari, referred to as the technology director of the Basij Student Organization (young paramilitaries supporting the Islamic regime), claimed that 17 million Iranians are on Facebook even though the site has been leaked in Iran... and that "the 300,000 websites of the Persian League are fighting against our religious and national beliefs".
Donayeh Eghtesad, an Iranian newspaper, wrote in 2010:
Two years earlier, Hamshari, an Iranian news website, wrote that "national internet" is an ambiguous term.
They quote a media expert who says that if this project seeks 100% of the international internet's filtering and expulsion, it is neither useful nor operational.
So, whose national internet is the favorite?
According to Hamshari, the Iranian parliament refused to give an initial $10 million five years ago, forcing the government to seek other funding.
And if the idea of the "national internet" wasn't ambiguous enough, Iranian communications minister Reza Taghipour launched another term: "clean internet".
He said they wanted to shield the internet from dirty actions and protect humans.
He said that at first, the internet was created for peaceful purposes, but now there are stains on it.
He explains the difference between a filter system and this idea of a clean internet.
For the first there is a blacklist (filtered sites), but for the second there will only be a whitelist (restricting the internet to permitted sites).
Now that we talk about a clean internet or even a Halal internet, we could also call it a virtual Frankenstein.
Russia: Demographic crisis means there's no one left to recruit
Russia has one of the world's largest reserves of natural resources, and yet the demographic crisis that has plagued the country since the fall of the Soviet Union may leave Russia without youths to defend their homeland.
Russia's total life expectancy is #161 in the world, placing it behind Belarus, North Korea and Mongolia, while Russia's total fertility rate is 196 in the world.
There are currently about 138 million people in Russia and many believe that if that number drops below 100 million, Russia will not be able to function as an industrialized country.
In November 2011, the blog War News Update published an article by RIA Novosti titled "The Russian Army 'no longer has anyone to recruit'":
Mexico, wake up!
Artists united for peace
For example, singer Ely Guerra was recorded portraying Marisela Escobedo, a mother who fought for justice over her daughter's death.
Although her daughter's husband confessed to killing her, authorities said there was insufficient evidence.
The Ambulance Project website describes the following video:
Piro Pendas (Ritmo Peligroso), Mexican musician, gives voice to the story of Leonardo, which is the history of our country.
There's no deadline for video delivery as it's an ongoing project.
Names are changed by numbers and this makes us out of the tragedy.
Every victim has a name and behind it is a life, a story, a family.
Carlos Avilés gives his voice to Juan Carlos Medrano.
Another 14 young people were killed and at least 20 were wounded.
They were all between 15 and 20.
Experiences experienced on Global Voices Aymarata during 2011
I'm Victoria Tinta and I want to share my experience with Global Voices in a very brief way.
I started translating for Global Voices Aymarata since 2009, during which time I only translated one article a month, between topics such as politics, sports, education, environment and others.
But since I took over as editor, I am no longer translating just one, but I am translating more than 5 articles a month.
I always do all these translations in my spare time; I finish a written post in one, two, even three hours, depending on the length; and when translating and editing I have been able to keep myself informed of the situations that were happening in other countries.
Among the translations I made is a theme that remains engraved in my mind and it is this: Languages: Let's tweet and talk in Quechua.
For me at the time what I was reading to translate was something interesting, and this is the translation into Aymara: Arunaka: Tuytiyañani ukatx qhichwat arsuñani.
Some of the translators of Global Voices Aymarata
Being a volunteer translator really makes me feel happy, and I'm looking forward to continuing.
On the other hand, I congratulate the translators of Global Voices Aymarata Nayraqatar sarantasipkakima!
Irma Silveria Laura Apaza writes:
The translations I made for the Global Voices Aymarata site were from June 2011, and I have always been interested in what is related to languages and I think it is very important to revaluate what Aymara is, especially to make this Aymara language known through the Internet and to make other people interested in translations.
In all the time I've been translating, the one that caught my attention was the one from Slovakia: The most expensive Apple computers and in Aymara is: Slovakia: Apple computaduranakax sinti jila chaniniwa.
And people don't care about that, college students have cutting-edge technology to study no matter how expensive the machines are, nowadays having a computer is no longer a privilege but a necessity.
Most students have a netbook and as in all countries some teachers are behind in what is technology.
Martha Valencia Intimayata writes:
My person has been involved in Global Voices Aymarata since 2010 and I translate since then, so I keep myself informed about what is happening in the world.
Over time and as I have been translating very interesting topics, among them what struck me most was: Iran: Blogueera receives 50 lashes and this is the translation into Aymara: Iran: Blogueerax phisqa tunk jawqaw katuqatäna.
What struck me was how a blogger can get 50 lashes for giving information, which I think is very bad.
Personally, I started translating last year, in the first few months.
First of all, it is a great satisfaction to be able to contribute to the growth of the language on the Internet, and particularly on Global Voices Online.
As for the translation I do for Global Voices Aymarata, I think it is for the good of speakers of the Aymara language, the Aymara language itself, as the status rises considerably when on the Internet.
The issue that most affected me was the help that humanitarian workers received during and after the rescue work after the earthquake in Japan: Japan: Helping humanitarian workers and in Aymara: Japan: Japunan yanaptirinakar yanaptasa.
Emma Quispe Mamani writes:
I have been translating for Global Voices Aymarata since February 2011, so I have been translating for a year now, and the most interesting thing about translations is that when translating you are informed about very important issues happening in the world, and this is very important to me; but what most impacted me was the topic of: Zambia: Cybernouts start counting back the promise of change in 90 days and this is the Aymara translation: Zambia: Cibernautanakax 90 mark urun turkakipañwitx niyaw jakhuñ qalltapxi And I will continue translating because I liked to translate in Aymara.
Elias Quispe Chura writes:
It all started when my colleague Rubén invited me to be a part of the Jaqi Aru project.
So I didn't think twice about joining it, because I was looking for opportunities to apply what I learned during my college career.
Soon, I was taught how to handle tools at Global Voices Aymarata, which I found very interesting and a little complicated.
I've been doing all this because I love translating different languages.
Moreover, it is about contributing to the native language, and above all sharing it with society through the Internet.
Among them, one of the articles that caught my attention was about Mexico: Celebrating the 100 years of Cantinflas .
I chose the subject because I am a fan of the famous comedian, and I wanted to learn more about his life, career, and I learned a lot from translating.
To begin with, I put myself in his shoes, I felt him and I understood that he didn't become famous overnight, but it was a whole process with virtues and sorrows.
Although there were certain limitations in Aymara vocabulary versus others, those stumbling blocks have been taken to the background, and are now gradually being overcome.
I would really love for writers on Global Voices to post content that doesn't exist on the page.
This would give me more options for choosing the topics to translate into Aymara, and not just the choice.
We must communicate with the world.
Cameroon: Motorcycle drivers and citizens of Duala clash violently
On December 31, in Deido, a popular district of Duala, the financial capital of Cameroon, a riot broke out between the area's residents and motor taxi drivers, also known as "benskiners".
According to this article in the newspaper Le Jour and several testimonies from Cameroonian internet users, this type of altercation occurs frequently.
Elie Kopter explains on Facebook the reason for the riots:

Singapore: Ministers accept salary cuts
Singapore's government ministers are among the highest paid in the world; Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong makes more money than Barack Obama, David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy combined.
The issue of high minister salaries was a hot topic in the 2011 General Election, and after the People's Action Party (PAP) won the lowest number of votes in history, Prime Minister Lee convened a committee to review ministerial salaries.
Unlike the general and presidential elections where efforts were made to work with new media, access to the press conference was not allowed for news agencies, online media and bloggers.
Bolivia: The public meeting of "Connecting Us"
The three-day event "Connecting Us" intentionally had a maximum of 35 participants and 5 moderators.
This allowed for greater interaction and connection between those who attended.
However, we know that the problem of increased participation in the Internet by the Bolivian sector is a topic of debate that should include the entire community.
That is why, as part of the meeting, a public meeting was held on the afternoon of 13 December, free and open to the general public.
The following is the programme of the event, which was attended by prominent speakers, some of whom took part in the meeting and others were invited.
Presentation: The evolution of digital high
Speakers: Mario Durán Chuquimia (the high)
Until a few years ago, the number of bloggers in El Alto, a city of more than a million people, could be counted on the fingers of one hand.
Today, it is a city with digital dynamics, where young people browse the Internet more than any other city in the country.
We'll hear about this story and some of the initiatives that are helping to reduce the digital divide in El Alto.
We will also hear the experiences of a veteran blogger and those who use citizen media to show the other side of the city to the rest of the country and the world.
How to connect in Bolivia
Speakers: Annelissie Arrázola and Jessica Olivares (Santa Cruz)
We know that social media offers great opportunities for communication.
However, to reduce the digital divide and promote participation, 'real-life' connections are more important than ever.
These digital initiatives and training projects need partnerships and partnerships to ensure greater reach and success.
In this presentation, two leaders from the city of Santa Cruz will talk about their experiences in creating these connections to make things happen.
Discuss: First steps towards a more responsive public sector
Moderator: Wilfredo Jordan (the high)
Panelists: Marisol Murillo Velásquez, Deputy Minister of Defence of Consumer Rights (@consumidorbo)
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat fraud.
Diego Andrés Gonzales Rioja  Manager of the Process of the Autonomous Statute, Departmental Assembly of Cochabamba (@asambleacbba)
Government agencies and public institutions are increasingly recognizing the importance of the internet for interacting with citizens.
The Facebook profiles and Twitter accounts of some of these entities allow for greater communication with them.
These initiatives are a great first step, but how can more people, especially those in the lower sections of society, be reached?

Discussion: Native languages in cyberspace
The report is based on the results of the survey.
Panelists  Ruben Hilare (High), Victoria Tinta (High), Ignacio Tomichá Chuvé (Santa Cruz)
When you search the Internet, it is very difficult to find content in these languages.
We will talk about the challenges indigenous communities face when using these languages on the Internet.
We also talked about initiatives that help promote the use of these languages on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube as a way to motivate new generations to revitalize these languages.
Speaker: Juan Ernesto Luna Ulloa (El Alto), National Coordinator of the youth network Diversa Boliviana
The LGBT community in Bolivia has had to hide in the shadows due to intolerance and discrimination from different social sectors.

The Africa Cup of Nations began in Bata, Equatorial Guinea, on Saturday 21 January, with three weeks of fierce competition beginning.
The Cup, the most important international football competition in Africa, takes place in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea between 21 January and 12 February.
Fans in Africa and around the world have been enjoying the growing atmosphere before the two opening matches: dancing, lights and sound were part of the show:
GaGuie the pet!

Here's a summary of the first three days of the tournament.
First day of matches
Libya faced Equatorial Guinea in the opening match on 21 January, and it was Equatorial Guinea, in its first match, that co-hosted, who won a surprising 1-0 victory.
The Senegalese failed to enter the competition with a 2-1 defeat to Zambia on the same day.
Senegal fans took to the web to blame the national team's technical director.

Language tools: Virtual keyboards and transliteration
Imagine you're writing in a language based on non-Latin characters and you're stuck in an internet cabin at a foreign airport trying to figure out how to send an email in your language.
Probably the PC you're using has a keyboard other than qwerty and there's no multilingual support in the operating system.
There are some online tools that can be of great help.

Peru: Water March approaching Lima
The Water March, which started from Cajamarca on 1 February, is still progressing, and after getting a good reception in the La Libertad Region and more adherence from farmers, fishermen and ecologists as it passes through the Ancash Region, it is already approaching Lima.
The anchashinos made four central demands for joining the march: intangibility of basin headlands, ban on mining with cyanide and mercury, right to consultation of the people and declaring water a constitutional right.
The Observation Mission issued its report of the day, which identifies certain problems related to the march that we had already mentioned in previous posts:
Meanwhile in Lima, the marchers are already preparing to receive them on Thursday, February 9.
The blog Gran Marcha Nacional de Agua posts the routes of the march in Lima, and in Seamos a río they post requiring donations:
A look at Rising Voices' microfinance proposals
From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe, Rising Voices has received 1175 submissions from 124 countries around the world.
This increase in the number of applications compared to last year demonstrates the growing interest and need to bring citizen media to underrepresented communities.
While we were analyzing these projects, we thought our readers might be interested in some of the initial data from this call.
Two East African nations, Uganda and Kenya, are the first in the list of countries with the highest number of applications.
For a more concrete picture of how other countries are represented in terms of applications, look at the word cloud created by the Wordle site.
The size of the country's name is proportional to the number of requests received from that country.
Country-based Word Cloud - Click to enlarge the image.
Ninety-five percent of applicants submitted a proposal for the first time, meaning the remaining five percent had participated in previous calls for microfinance from Rising Voices, which began in 2007.
We asked the applicants to describe in detail the objectives of their project, and Education, Women, Gender, Indigenous Communities and Development were the most mentioned categories.
Project Terminology Word Cloud - Click to enlarge the image
These are just a few demographic details gathered in a preliminary examination of the 1175 proposals.
We will soon develop a map to help visualize the specific locations of origin of the proposals.
We will also make visible sites around the world that share similar interests related to the scope of their projects for citizen media.
Only those projects that have given Rising Voices permission to share that information publicly will be included on the map.
Iran: Internet shutdown ahead of protest day
Slow and intermittent Internet is a daily reality in Iran, but in recent days reports from within the country report that e-mails and secure Internet (https:) have become inaccessible, and that the Internet is so slow that anti-filtering programs cannot open web pages.
The partial outage began on Thursday 9 February 2012.
This Tuesday's protest marks the first anniversary of the demonstrations convened by Iranian opposition leaders in 2011 in solidarity with the popular uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia.
The physical repression during this day was brutal and left at least two dead in Tehran.

Spain: Student repression continues in Valencia
Just days after the brutal police charges at the Lluis Vives Institute in Valencia, students have again been subjected to beatings and violence by the police in a peaceful demonstration in which students were precisely protesting against police violence.
This time, the charges began in the afternoon with an unexpected forceful outburst by the students.
Valencia police chief Antonio Moreno himself has referred to the protesters as "the enemy", with these youths aged 12 to 17 being high school students.
Some 400 university students have been locked up at the University of Valencia as a protest and in the face of the imminent police charge within the University, the Dean has denied entry to the "forces of order" that intended to dissolve the young, invoking the principle of university autonomy.

Puerto Rico: March against the Gas Pipeline
Hundreds of people from across the island joined the "National March: Puerto Rico Firm Against the Gas Pipeline" held on Sunday, February 19 in the capital city of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
The march was convened by the community organization Casa Pueblo based in the municipality of Adjuntas.
Casa Pueblo has been the entity that has carried the singer's voice in the attempts to stop the so-called "Vía Verde" project.
Environmentalists have pointed out that if the project is built it would adversely affect the aquifers and forests along the route, with irreparable damage to the island's ecosystem.
They've called it the "Death Tube".
Photojournalist Ricardo Alcaraz shares some of his images of the demonstration.
All images have been republished with your permission.
People from all walks of life joined the demonstration called by Casa Pueblo.
The protesters marched from the Capitol to the Foraleza.
In the background you can see the west side of the Olympic House.
Several sectors have denounced that the project would cause serious damage to the flora and fauna of the island.
On the proposed route for the tube are several endangered species
Congressman Luis Gutiérrez also joined the demonstration.
There were a variety of artistic expressions during the protest.
No Puerto Rican protest can miss the music of the demonstrations' favourite: the full.
Languages: International Mother Language Day in Mali
As in other parts of the world, Mali celebrated the International Mother Language Day on February 21 in Bamako.
The event, organized by the Ministry of Education, brought together educators, students and others interested in promoting the use of the 13 native languages of Mali.
This year's theme focused on the production of printed books and learning materials in these languages, but there is a strong interest in the role technology plays in revitalizing those languages.

Boukary Konaté, a blogger who writes and tweets (@fasokan) in French, English and Bambara, spoke about the events of the day and his hopes that technology will play a role in promoting the use of these languages on the Internet.
Venezuela: Rumours about the President's health continue
In Venezuela, the rumors outweigh the news, particularly as regards the health of the President of the Republic.
Since the cancer diagnosis was made several months ago, opinions and forecasts have not ceased.
Numerous press releases and data claiming to come from reliable but unidentified sources insist on the severity of the disease, while official voices assure that Hugo Chávez has recovered enough to continue his long presidential career.
Once again, the projections for the future are divided.
However, a tone of uncertainty is maintained in the political discussion pending presidential elections in October this year, and in response to the results of the opposition candidate's primary election.
For supporters of a new presidential period in which Chávez continues to lead, new campaign strategies are needed that allow an effective recovery of the president, as Carola expresses in her post "Chávez we are all":

Singapore: Criticism of "offensive" government announcement
An advertising campaign carried out by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sport (MCYS) received attacks for perpetuating prejudice and discrimination against ex-offenders, victims of abuse, people from lower income strata and disabled people.
The campaign includes a series of four posters showing social workers and examples of cases where they have helped.
The words "ruined", "destroyed", "abandoned" and "hopeless" have been stressed.
These posters can be seen on the internet, as well as in public areas such as bus stops.
Although the Society for People with Disabilities said it supported the advertising, the ministry has been widely criticized by Singaporeans.
@flubberzz: "What the hell is going on with MCYS and the Starlight ad??, who in their right mind came up with this kind of campaign?"
In response, the MCYS spokesman clarified that the word "hopeless" in the poster does not refer to disabled people, but to the feeling of hopelessness they feel about their conditions.
Turkey: Police clashes with Kurds celebrating Newroz
The Kurdish population in Turkey is the largest ethnic group in the country, making up 20 percent of the population, about 20 million Kurds.
The Turkish State has subjected this ethnic group to discrimination and human rights violations.
At the same time, on the morning of the 20th, two prominent Kurdish websites were blocked, thus preventing them from sending information about the clashes.
Yekbun Alp tweeted the arrest of a Kurdish member of parliament in clashes between rioters and Kurds celebrating Newroz:
Another Kurdish activist tweeted this image of rioters firing tear gas at young Kurds, who respond with stones, expressing frustration at not being able to celebrate the Kurdish New Year without being attacked:

Argentina: Documentary about the descendants of indigenous people in Buenos Aires
This post is part of our special coverage of Indigenous Rights.
The documentary Runa Kuti, Urban Indigenas tells the stories of four descendants of indigenous people living in the city of Buenos Aires, and how they struggle to reclaim their identity, rediscover their culture and become a place in the city.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat fraud.
The documentary focuses on several descendants of original cultures living in Buenos Aires.
They tell their stories and share how they were raised: some grew up protected from their own roots, as their parents decided to take care of them from exclusion and discrimination, and so they did not teach them the indigenous language or culture; and others were raised without knowing their ancestral origins.
They decided to embrace and embrace their traditions and culture, and thus strengthen themselves and feel proud of their roots.
Runa Kuti, urban indigenous, directed by Paola Castaño and Dailos Batista Suárez, has participated in several film festivals and, to get the message out to as many people as possible, they have registered it under Creative Commons license.

UAE: Activist arrested for tweeting
Saleh Aldhaifairi's tweet when he was arrested
With the birth of the Arab Spring, the authorities in the UAE seem to be intimidated by any voice calling for reforms or changes.
It all started with the arbitrary arrests of five activists for signing an internet petition and their illegal detention for months before granting them 'forgiveness' as part of the annual national celebrations.
Shortly after, seven political activists were stripped of their citizenship following an order issued by Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates.
Dubai Police spokesman announced that Saleh Al Dhafairi has been arrested for incitement.
The spokesman confirmed that Al Dhafairi will be referred to the Attorney General after 48 hours emphasizing that the law punishes seditious people.
He added that what the defendant did falls under the jurisdiction of federal law.

Peru: Rains overwhelming rivers and flooding Loreto
The rains in Peru do not stop.
To heavy rains during February and March on much of Peru's Sierra coast and jungle, flooding is now added in the country's lowland forest, mainly the Loreto and Ucayali regions.
For weeks, the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service (Senamhi) of Loreto had warned of the high levels of overflow reached by the Huallaga, Ucayali, Marañón and Amazon rivers.
And although some authorities took action in this regard it seems that it was not with due anticipation, for example the Regional President of Loreto requested to declare Loreto in emergency when there were already 40,000 damaged by the floods.
Although the area dates back to the last century, no Belenian mayor has made a plan or a project to modernize the area, including the construction of decent housing and the incorporation of basic services.
Punchana and Iquitos are the most affected districts when rivers grow and a project must definitely be thought out or developed to avoid excessive expenditure of resources in support of the affected citizens, as there are certainly alternatives to solve these problems.
A television program from Iquitos broadcast this report on the floods:
Finally, the following video is several shots of the flooded city of Iquitos: Post originally posted on Juan Arellano's personal blog.

Tunisia: Harassment over ban on protests on the capital's main avenue
Tunisian internet users have expressed their displeasure over the ban on protesting on Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunisia, the capital's main avenue and the Tunisian equivalent of Cairo's Tahrir Square.
On March 28, the Tunisian Interior Ministry banned all kinds of protests, claiming to have received complaints from commercial and tourist businesses located on the avenue.

Slim Amamou, Tunisian blogger and former Secretary of State for Youth, tweeted: Has Interior become a legislator to ban the constitutional right to protest?
They say Habib Bourguiba Avenue is off limits...
What is this?
He called for a protest: The state of emergency ends tomorrow, March 30, in Tunisia.
Go and protest!
Don't listen to the words of the Interior.
Blogger and wikipedian Habib M'henni responded to Amamou's tweet saying: "An implicit extension of the state of emergency that we fear this month.
The prominent blogger Azyz Amami, who was imprisoned during the Tunisian Revolution, also responded to Slim Amamou's tweet:
Bolivia: A serious attempt to lift the UN ban on coca leaf?
Public actions and demonstrations, led by coca producers and traders, took place on Monday 12 March 2012 in many cities in Bolivia, demanding the international decriminalization of the coca leaf.
Eduardo Bowles, a blogger based in La Paz, commented:
We must remember that this is not the first time that the Bolivian president will perform the ritual of the hook at the UN, which did not result in tangible benefits for the image of cocaine in the world.
The goal of the coca unions and the Bolivian government is to decriminalize not only coca cultivation but also its consumption, which is prohibited by the United Nations Convention on Narcotic Drugs, something President Morales has called a "historic mistake".
However, Mario Duran Chuquimia, a blogger from El Alto, says:
However, in Bolivia the situation is more complex.
A study by Celin shows that the stool tends to drop.
It identifies the mining sector as the most coca-picking
Another journalist, Andrés Gómez (@AndrsGomezV), director of the community radio network Erbol, also commented on Twitter:
Good morning on the day dedicated to remembering that acullicu is unjustly prohibited in Bolivia by the 1961 Convention

Kuwait: Stateless people light candles for freedom
In protest against the state's discriminatory policies and arbitrary arrests, the stateless community in Kuwait (or Bedoon, an Arabic word meaning "without" or "dispossessed"), decided to light candles in their homes and post photos of the event on Twitter.
The idea was suggested by 7anthala blogger Al-Bedoon, who thought it would be a message to the authorities that "the struggle continues and that their peaceful opposition will not cease until they get their rights".
On Wednesday, April 4, a torrent of photos flooded Twitter, in an attempt by people to express themselves through candles.
Here are some of the images shared:

Armenia: How to reduce poverty in villages
With a GDP (Gross Domestic Product) per capita estimated in 2011 at only $5 400, Armenia is one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union.
But while the development of the capital's centre, Yerevan, may give a different impression to some tourists, especially for its large diaspora, the economic situation is more pronounced in the regions of the southern Caucasus.
"What we are trying to do is gather information and disseminate it, so that people can have an understanding of what village life is like in Armenia", explains the text accompanying a promotional video of ը գնում է գյուղ (Tim goes to the village), also known as Direct to the Village.
Using mainly internet tools, a blog as well as a site on Facebook and Pinterest are used to promote the initiative.

India: Young women learn to create participatory videos
A group of young women from the suburbs of Hyderabad in India are learning how to create videos to change their communities, and in their next recording they will explain what they have learned and how they are helping their communities and themselves through this work.
Namita Singh, who is doing her PhD research on participatory video, has a dual role in this process.
She is an experienced community video trainer and author of toolboxes and guides for media training for women and children. She also studies the learning process of these women.
While she was filming the video documenting the women's process, they asked her to continue training while they were filming.
Namita Singh comments on this experience on her blog:  Namita Singh, the trainer versus Namita Singh, the researcher: things I taught and things I learned! :
After all, the people they wanted to engage with the video were primarily their community.

Video: Indigenous communities document their growth and governance
The Portal Territorio Indígena y Gobernanza is made up of institutions that work together to provide the indigenous peoples of Latin America with the tools and resources to help strengthen the governance of their territory and their community.
Through short videos they document their progress.
In Colombia, the Association of Indigenous Cabildos of the North of Cauca (ACIN) brings together more than 14 reserves and 16 indigenous cabildos, and through their efforts, indigenous communities have begun to take control of their own economy and environment.
They do this through small dairy, fruit juice, pancake and bread production companies, and market these products to supply Community shops and help other social projects in the community.
Through barter, training and product centralization, they seek to provide food security to indigenous communities and also provide sources of income.
In Ecuador, the Pastaza Kichwa Nation has a territory of 1624 778 hectares belonging to 131 communities.
They have been managing the area sustainably for several years now, and in the following video they share their experiences in developing a Territorial Management Plan.
This plan, based on zoning their territory, allows them to live off the land for many years without depleting it and at the same time exercise their constitutional rights to make use of their own land.
So far, only these two videos have been released.
We hope that more will be done, based on experiences in other Latin American countries.

This post is part of our special coverage of the protests in Bahrain 2011.
Ever since the uprisings began around the Arab world, we've become accustomed to seeing the image of thousands of protesters taking to the squares and streets.
Phrases like March of a Million Men have been added to the dictionary, and scenes like the one below become symbols of the "Arab Spring".

This is the first time that the Commission has made a decision.
However, it takes more courage to be part of smaller demonstrations, where there are fewer people to defend others and fewer media to report any incident.

I still wonder how she has such courage, but I guess nothing can answer my question better than what she wrote in her Twitter biography:
Languages: The digital sounds of the beziro (Chiquitano)
The Bolivian Constitution recognizes 36 indigenous languages as official languages of the State.
Three of these languages, Quechua, Aymara and Guaraní, are the most widely spoken by a larger number of people and also because they are spoken in neighboring countries.
On the other hand, finding resources and content available in the other 33 languages is a constant challenge for their communities.
Currently, a project is being carried out in the department of Santa Cruz, which aims to address this issue through digital media to produce their own online content, in the hope of encouraging more people to preserve and promote their language.
In the Department of Humanities and Education of the Autonomous University Gabriel René Moreno in the city of Santa Cruz, a group of young linguists led by Ignacio Tomicha Chuve, has started a project called Monkox Bésiro in order to put the bessiro (Chiquitano) language within the digital map.
This language is spoken by the Chiquitano people in several provinces in the departments of Santa Cruz and Beni, with an estimated 20,000-60,000 speakers approximately.
In addition to opening an account on Twitter (@MonkoxBesiro) and a Facebook page, the project uses SoundCloud to upload recordings made by themselves or during visits to their native communities, such as San Antonio de Lomerio.
For example, here we have a short bilingual lesson in Bessiro and the correct pronunciation of consonants:

Quechua: Words of encouragement from the mayor of Haquira
When Irma Álvarez Ccoscco, coordinator of the new Rising Voices Llaqtaypa Riymaynin (Voices of my community) project, returned to her hometown of Haquira, Peru, she received an overwhelming show of support from residents and local authorities.
She was visiting from Lima and took the opportunity to inform the community that her project was recently selected as the new Rising Voices charity project.
The program seeks to work with migrants from Haquira who now live in the capital, encouraging them to maintain their native language, Quechua, by producing audio podcasts about their culture and community.
In the project blog, Irma describes this meeting with the city residents, which was convened via SMS messages.
After briefly describing the project to the people who were gathered and how this initiative will help tell the story of Haquira in the Quechua language, they invited Rolando Curiyumay, the mayor of the city, to eat "hakitu" (toasted wheat and wheat).
Irma wrote: "When you are in another land, family love and the need to share what you have arise".
After this fellowship, Curiyumay said some short poetic words with some advice for Irma and the project:

Another conflict on the TIPNIS road
This post is part of our special coverage of International Relations and Security.
The Bolivian road project that plans to cross the Isiboro Sécure National Park and Indigenous Territory (TIPNIS) is once again generating conflict and protest.
The 306-kilometer road plan is the result of a $415 million agreement signed by the presidents of Bolivia and Brazil in August 2009.
The TIPNIS march arrives in La Paz in October 2011.
By Szymon Kochański on flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)
In October 2011, after a long march of indigenous people and protesters had reached La Paz, President Evo Morales passed a law declaring TIPNIS intangible  or  untouchable , which was understood by environmental activists and indigenous organizations as the last word on the subject.
Indigenous residents of TIPNIS - backed by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB) say these constitutional mechanisms should have been carried out before any agreement or contract was signed.
A large number of indigenous organizations and citizens recognize that Evo Morales - himself an indigenous leader and cocaler - has improved his situation.
However, indigenous organizations stress that their protest is for their right to be consulted before policies regarding their territories are implemented.
This video shows interviews with indigenous people from TIPNIS and their views on the road project.
The environmental impact of the road is another problem that generates protests, particularly among the middle and urban class of Bolivia.
Still, the Bolivian government insists on the benefits of a road that would connect the central area of the country, from where most illegal coca is produced, and where Evo Morales seeks support from the bases.
Coca-Cola producer organisations openly support the road as it can provide opportunities to expand production in TIPNIS National Park.
Inevitably, this generates further suspicion among environmentalists, international organizations and public opinion.
The debate also continues on social media platforms, particularly Twitter (under the tag #TIPNIS).
One of the questions simply says are you for or against the #TIPNIS road?
Among the answers are:
I think it should be integrated into the country, if the optimal thing is to go through the TIPNIS  anyway,q the road passes x where it is best for Bolivia
Criticism also goes to the relationship between the road project and the Brazil-backed Initiative for the Integration of Regional Infrastructure in South America (IIRSA), a development plan to unite South American economies through new energy, transportation and telecommunications projects.
According to the article by researcher Gustavo Soto in the CEADESC blog:
Costa Rica: Climbing the highest peak in the country, Chirripó
The highest point in Costa Rica is Cerro Chirripó, at 3,820 metres (12,533 ft) above sea level.
Over the years, it has attracted many locals and foreigners to climb to the top: the following videos show us two very different experiences.
One of the first expeditions in 1960, and a hike to the summit in our time.
In the documentary Hikes of Courage: Climbing Chirripó in 1960, a team of young men and women make a long expedition to reach the highest peak in Costa Rica.
We follow their progress by car, oxen carriage and horseback, until they begin their week-long climb to the top.
It was also the first time that women were documented at the summit.
Narrated by one of the expeditionaries, meteorologist Rodrigo de la Ossa, the story is full of anecdotes about the journey, which is now being made by another shorter route.

Currently, the walk up to Chirripó is about 19.5 Km (12.1 miles), with an obligation to spend the night near the summit in a camp.
The following subtitled documentary by tetsuo1337 shows her experience climbing to the top in 2010.
Venezuela: Street art on the Internet
Street artists and musicians expand their audience when they encounter citizen media.
In Venezuela, where music and theater are part of daily life, traffic and buses, some citizen journalists share their journeys when they meet artists who color urban life.
Similarly, the same artists prepare small videos and documentaries showing the performances of various street musicians.
In this video, made by the same artists for the street singers festival, you can see many of the musicians who are in various cities across the country:
At the same time, Cinetica13 shares the performance of a very popular street musician from the city of Mérida.
The theater also has its place in Venezuelan street art.
Perucho Morales shares on his YouTube account the performances of the group "Comediantes", also in Mérida.

Bolivia: Workshop teaches teachers how to manage Web 2.0 platforms
On May 2 and 3, 2012, a workshop on Web 2.0 management was held in the Department of Oruro, Bolivia.
This was organized in coordination with the Ministry of Education and Jaqi Aru, a group of young linguists in El Alto, Bolivia who are promoting the use of the Aymara language on the Internet.
Many members of the Global Voices Aymara translation team are also part of this group.
The workshop was aimed at the teachers of the Higher Schools of Teacher Education (ESFM), and the aim was to facilitate the teachers and their students to disseminate articles written in Aymara using digital media.
According to the programme, the workshop was held as follows:
On Thursday, May 3, at 9:30am in the meeting room, the workshop was inaugurated by the facilitators of the Jaqi Aru team.
Then Mario Duran Chuquimia gave a lecture on Web 2.0 and Wikipedia.
After noon, the workshops were held in a computer room, where each teacher had a computer with Internet access.
Martin Canaviri then spoke about social media management, focusing on Facebook, and Ruben Hilare shared about Twitter management.

Afghanistan: Girls poisoned for going to school
On June 3, 2012, about 65 girls were taken to hospital after being poisoned at their school in the northeastern Afghan province of Tajar.
On May 29, about 160 girls ended up in hospitals after a gas attack at their school.
The authorities have blamed the Taliban for these incidents.
Between 1996 and 2001, when the fundamentalist movement controlled most of the country, women were banned from attending school.
Although millions of girls have enrolled in school since the Taliban's overthrow, the movement's fighters and supporters continue to punish girls for seeking education.
Young schoolchildren are unconscious in the garden of a hospital in the northern province's capital city of Tajar after being poisoned at their school.

Because women continue to face abuse and violent attacks for seeking education, it takes a lot of courage to be a school girl in Afghanistan.

They deny involvement in these attacks, but their own story, in which many girls were not even allowed to go to school during the Taliban regime of 1996-2001, suggests that educated women are against the interests of the Taliban.

Protesters fighting to save Lake Urmia in Iran from permanent environmental damage have not given up.
On May 21, 2012, people in Urmia and several other cities in Iran's Azerbaijan region again called on the government to save the dying Lake Urmia, one of the world's largest saltwater lakes.
In Khoy (pictured), protesters hung a sign on a bridge that says "the death of Lake Urmia is the death of Azerbaijan".
A blogger posted a caricature saying "We save Lake Urmia with our tears".
Here are a couple of videos of the demonstrations in Urmia posted by Iranian citizens.

A group of 15 to 20 supporters of Golden Dawn, the Greek neo-Nazi political party that surprisingly achieved great success in the last election, attacked a Pakistani man of about 30 on May 29, 2012 in Athens, specifically at the Agios Nikolaos metro station, a neighborhood known for its high immigrant population.

Saudi Arabia: Protests for the release of those detained without trial
It is believed that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has thousands of detainees who have not been allowed access to justice and many of them are not even aware of their charges.
The families of the detainees have been working through social media to spread the message these past months and finally decided to take their cause to the streets. @e3teqal, a Twitter account, posted information about the protest just before it began to avoid a strong police presence.
Days before the protests, the account hung this invitation that showed pictures of the detainees in the same way that Palestinian prisoners were symbolized in a recent social media campaign:
The account also posted a photo confirming the children of the detainees' children's participation in the protest:
Sign reads: Haila Al-Qasir was sentenced to 15 years in prison for calling for justice, is that fair?
We stand in solidarity with our brothers in Riyadh; we couldn't come because our male guardians are in jail.
The news of the arrests was posted on the internet shortly after the protests.

Iran: Jailed blogger starts hunger strike
To the dramatic situation of Iranian bloggers now adds a new victim: Hossein Ronaghi Maleki, a blogger in prison, sentenced to 15 years in prison.
Her father claims that prison is torture because of her kidney problems.
Hossein has been in the operating room five times, but after each operation he has been sent back to prison, which has no medical equipment, no proper food for him or specialists in nephrology.
Hossein began a hunger strike on May 19, 2012 for a simple reason: to have the right to stay in the hospital after the operation and not return to prison.
Adam Evolution says about Hossein Ronaghi Maleki:
He's not a singer or a football player; he's not a showman or an actor.

Photos: internal meeting before the Global Voices Summit
For three days in the lead-up to the 2012 Global Voices Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, our community has been gathering together privately to discuss new issues and ideas related to Global Voices.
To learn more about the process, read this long post, and enjoy these images from the meetings of Global Voices members anyway.
Mexicans elect their next president
On July 1, Mexicans went to the polls to elect their next president.
Since before the elections, the feeling among most cyber-nuts was that it would be a very close race between Enrique Peña Nieto (EPN) of the Institutional Revolutionary Party and Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) of the Party of the Democratic Revolution, although the supporters of Josefina Vázquez Mota (of the current ruling party) did not lose hope.
As soon as the polls opened, the netizens began sharing their ideas and experiences.

Review of the first day of the Global Voices Citizens Media Summit
The 2012 Global Voices Summit began on July 2 in Nairobi with a song performed by award-winning Kenyan artist Atemi, who took the stage to welcome the more than 300 attendees to the capital.
The event is a biannual event that brings together bloggers, activists and technologists from around the world to hold public debates and workshops on the rise of social media movements around the world.

Following a warm welcome from Daudi Were, founder of Kenyan Blogs Webring, American social media scholar and Global Voices co-founder Ethan Zuckerman moderated an international discussion table on the rise of social media.
Southeast Asian GV editor Mong Palatino showed us an overview of several campaigns on social media in the region, including #thaiflood and Bersih.
He explained how a mixture of activism on and off the internet could lead to real mobilizations and changes.
Amira al-Hussaini, a prominent activist from Bahrain, explained how the protests in Egypt and Tunisia last year served as an inspiration to the Arab region and later the world.
Matisse Bustos Hawkes, of the WITNESS organization, explained how people share and disseminate information even where the internet has little reach, through USB, CD and DVD memory.
Finally, Pakistani Faisal Kapadia expressed concern that we are witnessing the golden age of internet freedom, if we do not act against censorship.
Then began the sessions, one on social networks of Kenyan citizens, which highlighted how cyber tools and channels are not only conveying opinions but also affecting how people live in the country (follow #kot on Twitter to learn about the latest rumors on Kenyan social networks). #Occupy Everywhere, for its part, deals with the different global "enemies" but with a common goal: equal rights and justice.
The challenge of keeping endangered languages alive on the Internet was also discussed, including issues such as lack of writing, as well as letters and fonts on keyboards.
The afternoon "non-conference" sessions allowed audience members to propose and lead discussion groups on a wide range of topics such as "How Facebook Spy On You", #OccupyYourself and current issues about Burma (Myanmar).
Discussion groups at #GV2012
Bob Boorstin of Google, Max Schrems (Europe vs. Facebook) and Ramzi Jaber (onlinecensorship.org) joined Ivan Sigal of GV in the debate 'Internet giants: Their role and responsibility?'
Bob Boorstin said that the internet is not a place without borders  if you cross boundaries, laws change  and also expressed his belief that technological monopolies do not last.
Ramzi Jaber announced the publication of onlinecensorship.org, a website where you can report whether your account or content is being censored.
Ory Okolloh, the original editor of GV Africa and co-founder of Ushahidi, who is also Google's current policy officer on Africa, answered a question from the audience about whether users of the African network are aware of how to protect their rights on the internet.
As a cologne to a great day, the presentation of the Breaking Borders award took place: read the following report.

Global Voices' second day review of the Citizens Media Summit
Group photo of the 2012 Summit
The second and final day of the Global Voices Citizens Media Summit 2012 began just as it ended the first night: with music.
As the audience woke up and sat down, a quartet of musicians, the group Sheru ni Sheru, marched to the stage playing the drum and dancing to the beat of the morning call.
Fully alert, the summit was presented to Boukary Konaté of Mali and Victoria Tinta of Bolivia, both winners of the GV's Rising Voices scholarships.
Currently, Boukary, along with others, is leading the Segu Villages Connection Project.
This project runs through each of the schools in rural Mali and seeks to create cultural ties between the city and the villages by teaching how to use the network.
Victoria Tinta grew up in Bolivia speaking the Aymara language and during college began using the Internet to mobilize the Aymara community.
Currently, Victoria works with a group called Jaqi Aru, which runs bloggers' workshops for Aymara speakers in order to strengthen the Aymara language's presence on the network.
The Summit was then divided into three groups of special panels.
Jillian York launched the provocative program titled "Are They Watching Us?", which sparked a debate about potentially justified surveillance and the needs for privacy and political freedom. Robert Faris, director of research at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, explored the exchanges between law enforcement and transparency standards, while citizen journalists Afef Abrougui from Tunisia and Mohamed El Gohary from Egypt described the dangers and practical obstacles facing dissidents of government and corporate surveillance.
In another group, panelists met to discuss the importance of using citizen media to organize mass actions, especially focused on Kenya.
After a brief break, the Summit continued with a second round of special sessions.
Gilad Lotam, vice president of SocialFlow, moderated "Information Visualization", which explores the methods through which analysts and promoters gather, sort and project information in both activist and scientific contexts.
Rebecca MacKinnon, co-founder of GV, chaired a separate panel on citizen participation in the future of the Internet, and asked those present to focus on how ordinary people act when governments do not defend the people's interests.
A third group met to discuss the challenge of "creating an African network", and the things that are necessary to establish relationships and unity between local citizen media and the outside world to support the project.
After lunch, the Summit started two sets of open programs covering about a dozen different topics, such as China-Africa relations, women and technology, and open resources.
Finally, before the Summit ended with a night of music and a Kenyan barbecue, Global Voices paid tribute to its co-founders and organizers.
When CEOs Ivan Sigal and Georgia Popplewell formally concluded the Summit, a group of more than 200 people, including GV staff and volunteers, local scholars and visitors stood up and marked the occasion with applause and smiles.
See you at the next Summit!
Spain: support for the mining struggle:  Yes, they represent us!
Thousands of people took to the streets to show their support for the Spanish miners and join them after arriving in Madrid after walking 400 kilometers from northern Spain.
The demonstration began at 22h on Tuesday, July 10, in La Moncloa, the seat of government, and ended at the Sun Gate around two in the morning.
Coal miners are protesting the austerity measures of Mariano Rajoy's government and government cuts to subsidies.
This event, called the "Black March", took place in a very emotional and solidarity-filled environment.
The miners expressed surprise at the strong mobilization they achieved, adding to the intensity of what is known in the networks as the #nocheminera.
Tour of the Black March through the centre of Madrid, by Ismael Naranjo
The most vocal slogans were: "Yes, you can!" "Yes, they represent us!" and "This is our team!" "This is our team!" in reference to Spain's recent European Cup victory.
Coal workers not only lit the streets with lanterns on their fronts, they were also light for the protesters in a broader sense.
Many other sectors identified themselves with his cause, including anarchists, 15M indignates, people of all ages and from various regions of Spain.
The mining struggle, more than any other protest in Spain, has become the fist of workers' protest and the most radical rejection of government cuts.
The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement.
On social media, many people encouraged miners to continue fighting cuts that could lead to the disappearance of their sector.
A large number of tweets claimed to be proud of Spain's miners through their messages and through the hashtag #yosoyminero.
As in previous protests, it was the networks that released most of the information, against what users denounced as a #silenciomediatic.
The historic mining protest resumed in the capital on Wednesday, July 11, from the morning.
However, it turned out to be a much more terrible day than the previous one, due to violent clashes between anti-rioters and protesters.
The altercations resulted in more than 76 wounded and a dozen detainees.
A weak African Union for its 53 member countries
This post is part of our coverage of International Relations and Security.

2011 was a tumultuous year for the African continent, with revolutions, attempted coups and violent political crises.
Unfortunately, the Union of 53 African States whose mission is to contribute to the strengthening of regional peace and development has shown its own shortcomings in dealing with these situations.
The African Union, created in 1999 following the dissolution of the Organisation of African Unity, was unable to resolve the Ivory Coast post-election crisis, offering late support to the Arab Spring popular movements, and its position on Libya was largely determined by the influence of the late Colonel Gaddafi on the organisation.
All this has led many African citizens to question whether the Union is really capable of fulfilling its mission.
This is very clear when studying the blogs of commentators from across the region.
In the crisis unfolding in Mali, the organisation seems to be drifting away.

Declaration for Internet Freedom
As many have pointed out, the world is at a crucial moment in terms of internet freedom.
In many countries, laws have been created to censor the network, while bloggers are increasingly at risk for speaking up.
Over the past year, organizations around the world have come together as never before to fight for internet freedom.
From the fight against SOPA and PIPA laws in the United States, to the global efforts to end the Trade Agreement Against Counterfeiting (ACTA), we have embraced a spirit of freedom and openness on the Internet.
With this in mind, numerous groups have recently joined forces to draft a Declaration for Internet Freedom, of which Global Voices Advocacy has been one of the original signatories.
To date, this declaration has been signed by more than 1300 organisations and companies, and this number continues to grow.
The text of the statement can be read below.
You can sign the statement here; you can also participate through different organisations, such as EFF, Access, and even Cheezburger.
The problem
We believe that a free and open internet can make a better world.
To keep the internet free and open, we ask communities, businesses and countries to recognize these principles.
We join an international movement to defend our freedoms because we believe it's worth fighting for.
We discuss these principles,  we will accept or refute them, we will debate them, we will translate them, we will make them our own and we will spread the discussion to our community  as only possible on the internet.
Join us so that the Internet remains free and open.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts in accordance with Article 21 of this Regulation.
We stand for a free and open internet.
We support transparent and participatory processes for regulating the internet and the establishment of five basic principles:
Expression: The internet should not be censored.
Access: Promoting universal access to fast and affordable networks.
Opening: The Internet must remain an open network where everyone is free to connect, communicate, write, read, see, speak, listen, learn, create and innovate.
Innovation: Protecting the freedom to innovate and create without permission.
New technologies should not be blocked, and innovators should not be punished for the actions of users.
Privacy: Protect privacy and defend people's ability to control how their data and devices are used.

Argentina: Liu Song, table tennis player, shocked by Twitter
Being a Chinese nationalized Argentinian, with barely a rudimentary Spanish, he represented us and did his best, so I think he represents all those other disciplines that don't "sell" that don't get up the rating but go unnoticed for four years and nobody gives the slightest attention to them, to them, the best of wishes, and eye, not to be confused, which doesn't mean you don't support the "famous" disciplines but what I want is that they are all important, even if the only chance is to just pass a round.
Song, who has already represented Argentina at the 2000, 2004 and 2008 Olympics, revolutionized Argentine tweets, and that's why throughout the weekend the #Songuito tag, as Song's diminutive, was a local trend.
@pibecristino: ♬ #songuito, my good friend, this Olympics we'll go back to this one with you, we'll teach you Spanish ♬

Bolivia: Does anti-US rhetoric damage your diplomatic relations?
This post is part of our special coverage of International Relations and Security.
In the last decade, the balance of power has changed in South America.
The US hegemony in the region in the second half of the 20th century has been challenged, mainly by the strong emergence of Brazil, but also by political initiatives led by leftist governments such as Bolivia.
Despite its relatively small size, the landlocked country in the heart of South America has led anti-U.S. initiatives since 2006, when President Evo Morales, a left-wing indigenous leader and coal miner unionist, was democratically elected.
Raul Prada Alcoreza, a former member of President Morales' party, describes the diplomatic context in the early days of 2006 in his blog:
Hong Kong: 10,000 people in concentration against 'National Education'
Controversy over the new "red" curriculum has grown over the past week, with parents' groups joining the affected students and teachers to prevent the government from introducing the curriculum in September.
On July 29, 2012, 10,000 Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest against the curriculum's brainwashing.
Despite the danger of extreme heat, many parents carried their babies.
Below is a selection of some of the photos from the concentration, with permission for use:
The sign says, "Mom and Dad take a step forward.
Let's stop the national education".

Mexico: Climbing mountains to fight the water crisis
The challenge is to raise awareness of the global water and sanitation crisis and raise funds to ensure clean water for people.
Challenge 21 founder Jake Norton is looking to do this by climbing the top 3 peaks on every continent and the next couple of videos give us a glimpse of what he's doing.
Josh Wolff documented the climb, the first in his life, with a video and an article on Gadling travel blog.
My most recent adventure took me to the border between Puebla and Veracruz in Mexico to try to reach the third highest peak in North America (18,500 feet), the stratovolcano Pico de Orizaba.
It wasn't a common climb.
It is one of the most pressing issues of our time.
With seven summits already conquered, including Mount Everest, Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Stanley as well as three North American peaks, the 3-4-year project is quite advanced.
The Youtube channel of Challenge 21 has several videos of the Everest expedition, as well as many showing the sanitation facilities at Everest Base Camp.

Sharing pictures of Afghanistan you never see
Decades of war and terrorism have placed Afghanistan among the most dangerous countries in the world.
Sharing his views on the label, Ford writes in Warfare magazine:
Local kids ready to talk to military personnel leaving the helicopter landing site.
The tag has become a popular photo tag for those traveling to Afghanistan to share images that people outside the country rarely see in mainstream media.
Then Iqbal Ahmad Oruzgani, a photographer from Afghanistan, started posting photos with the tag to show Afghanistan from a different perspective.

Iran: When earthquakes kill, "TV broadcasts prayers"
Two strong earthquakes shook the province of East Azerbaijan, northwest of Iran, on Saturday, August 11, 2012, killing 250 and injuring about 1,800 people.
The earthquakes had a magnitude of 6.4 and 6.3 degrees, and left a trail of destruction and suffering.
The representative of Iran's supreme leader in East Azerbaijan said that this earthquake reminds us of "Judgment Day".
People are under the rubble and need help, but Iranian channels broadcast religious programming and one of them shows "Under America"...
Aandishe reflects on the tragedy, wondering why she never learns from mistakes:

Historic photos commemorating the anniversary of the 1988 Myanmar uprising
On 8 August 2012, 24 years have passed since the biggest upheaval in Myanmar's political history - the 1988 democracy protests.
Although the public has had to commemorate in silence without any leader opposing the activist generation's 88th-generation government in past years, it was likely that this year's anniversary would include uprising leaders such as Min Ko Naing, Ko Ko Gyi, among others.
A Facebook page known as Myanmar Political Review, which was created in July and gathered over a thousand fans in a few days, shared several photos with views before the 1988 uprising.
Here are some of those images:

This year, Myanmar's President, Thein Sein, officially sent two ministers to the monastery where a donation ceremony for the Buddhist full moon day of Warso was held on August 7 by members of the Generation 88 Student Organization.
The two ministers, representing the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Transport by Rail, respectively donated to the monastery for the ceremony and the Generation 88 Student Organization.

Lebanon: Bank robber shot by army officer
Bolivia: new campaign to boost tourism
'Bolivia awaits you' is the name of the new promotional campaign recently launched by the Bolivian government.
The campaign seeks to boost tourism and focuses on a promotional spot that will be broadcast on major television networks in the Americas and Europe as well as promoting domestic tourism through the United for Tourism programme.
The Bolivian government announced that it will invest 20 million dollars over the next five years to strengthen and promote community-based tourism and that it will benefit primarily indigenous communities.
Citizens reacted to the campaign immediately on social media.
Great, they made me want to travel!!
Our country is truly beautiful. Congratulations on your efforts to promote it and showcase our beautiful landscapes and culture.
Let us stop looking at the negative in our productions and support the efforts that others make on behalf of all Bolivians.
Call for proposals: ICT camps for social change in Nicaragua and Guatemala
Adapted from the original call on Activistmo's website.
The Commission has decided to extend the period of validity of the application for a licence to the European Union.
Rising Voices will be participating as an ally in workshops in Nicaragua and Guatemala aimed at young people using digital media for social change.
Together with our partner Hivos and the workshop organizers, Dialogía, these camps called "Activism" will bring together people between the ages of 18 and 25 who are taking advantage of the Internet and its various tools to promote change, make denunciations, organize activism or build participatory spaces in one or several of the following thematic axes: Environment (includes sustainable development, agroecology, water resource, mining and the like).

Venezuela: Amuay in chaos after oil refinery explosion
A gas tank exploded at 1am today, August 25, at Amuay Refinery, in Judibana, Falcón state.
Several citizen videos of the explosion have been shared on YouTube:
Jose Luis Cova R (@JLCova) commented through his Twitter account:

Most of the injured and affected by the blast were taken to the Calles Sierra Hospital which does not have enough supplies to care for people there, as Gabriela Gonzalez (@gabriela2400) reported:
Pakistan: a water-powered engine?
A Pakistani engineer stated that he could make a car run on a water engine.
Agha Waqar Ahmad, the proud inventor of the motor, is these days in the mouths of all traditional and social media; he became famous after having recently participated in several interview programs.
Pakistanis are overwhelmed by the idea of a water-powered engine.
Several government officials saw a live demonstration of the engine and showed great interest in it.
People are already considering switching their cars to a water-powered GNC.
However, there are many skeptics on social media.
As soon as the news got out, the responses were not made to wait on Twitter and Facebook and ranged from fun to scathing to favorable.
It came to a point where the #WaterKit tag became very fashionable in Pakistan.
Ali Abbas Zaidi, a well-known youth activist, tweeted:
@Ali_Abbas_Zaidi: I can't stop laughing after watching @HamidMirGEO's show about #WaterKit.
To those who predicted the end of the world in 2012: Your comments are welcome.
@Ali_Abbas_Zaidi: Agha Waqar has ignored the rules of physics with #WaterKit.
@NadeemfParacha: Now, instead of oil, are we going to import barrels from Zamzam Well? #WaterKit.
It was clear that not everyone had the same sense of humor on the subject:
@Rabaail: All the Twitter biographies should be changed to  aspiring comedian  because everyone thinks #WaterKit is something very funny.
One of the complicating issues of this whole story is that so far none of the prestigious Pakistani physicists have personally examined the engine.
Cafe Pyala puts it this way:
@cpyala: Among the scientists  who support the invention of the #WaterKit car are a biologist and a centrifuge machinist. Very convincing! @HamidMirGEO
Majyd Aziz tweeted:
@Amjad_Hakro: Hyper-patriot #DrAbdulQadeerKhan, has referred to the  discovery  of #WaterKit as if it were real without having examined it scientifically. #fail #LOL.
Talha Zareef tweeted:
@TalhaZareef: My mom just told me that #WaterKit is real and that the demonstration proves it.
I think I'm definitely convinced.
Shahid Saeed, commented on the support of some scientists for the water engine:
@majorlyprofound: The laws of thermodynamics have been deemed null and unconstitutional, against our religion and culture. #WaterKit
Given that Pakistan is going through a serious energy crisis, it is understandable that people want to believe in a miracle.
But as they say, miracles don't exist.
This farce, which has been repeated dozens of times before, seems to be gaining traction in Pakistan.

Libya: hijab-free presenter forced to leave ceremony
There was a problem that spoiled the power transfer ceremony from the National Transitional Council of Libya (NTC) to the recently elected Libyan National General Congress of 200 members: the ceremonial teacher was Sarah Elmesallati, who did not wear a veil, and who was ordered to leave the stage after an Islamist parliamentarian left the ceremony in protest for being the presenter of the historic ceremony.
Internet users turned to Facebook to express their outrage or support.
According to some reports, Islamist MP Salah Baadi of Mistrata opposed Elmesallati to present the ceremony and shouted that he cover himself.
Afterwards, he left the ceremony as a protest and an assistant to the National Transition Council, President Mustafa Abduljalil, asked Sarah to stop presenting.
When Elmesallati refused, Abduljalil himself signaled him to stop immediately.
Eventually, she had to and was replaced by a presenter.
Screenshot of the Facebook page "We are all Sarah Elmesallati"
In response to this event, a Facebook page was created titled All We Are Sarah Elmesallati.
The page is being used to debate the situation of women in post-Gaddafi Libya but also to receive insults and support for the young presenter.
Also on Facebook this image is getting a lot of visitors:
A picture showing Abduljalil shaking hands with an uncovered Hillary Clinton.
It shows a photograph of Elmesallati and Abduljalil shaking hands with US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
The following can be read:
Host Sarah Elmesallati was expelled from the ceremony for not wearing hijab and being from Libya.
Abduljalil said: "We are a conservative Muslim society that celebrates its religious practices and preserves its traditions and customs".
Hillary Clinton is a woman who doesn't wear a hijab and she could also be considered an infidel for it.
When you shake his hand, didn't you tell him that for a man it's forbidden to shake a woman's hand?
Is this a religious practice or an American tradition?
The image has been shared more than 250 times and so far has sparked about 730 comments on the Facebook page "We're all Sarah Elmesallati".
In Libyablog, Ahmed Al Bukhari writes: Although this incident shocked me because I never thought anything like this could happen, and despite the deep discomfort of activists, including those on the Facebook page "We are all Sarah Elmasallati", I hold neither Mustafa Abduljalil nor the National Transitional Council responsible for what happened.
We need to admit that the big problem is the whole of society and if it did not allow this kind of discrimination, no one would dare to commit such actions.
On the other hand, Libya Now - also on Facebook - writes an open letter to Elmesallati after she defended herself in an interview.
A fragment of the letter reads: "I personally have not spoken much before about the Sarah Elmesallati case and said, 'She had to be informed in a different way.'
However, after watching your interview in this video, I've completely changed my mind.
In the video above, presumptuous Sarah Elmesallati claims that she knows hijab is an order from Allah and also said, "This is something between God and me".
He also said that Allah had commanded the believer to lower his eyes but not to command women and to ask them to put on the hijab.
This writer continues: She also said that we are a moderately religious state and I personally had to stress the word moderately.
That's not true, Sarah!
We are a completely Muslim country and you should fully examine and understand the expressions you have broadcast to this channel before you speak them out in public.
Senegal: floods kill 18 people and paralyze the country
On 26 August heavy rains caused catastrophic flooding in several regions of Senegal, causing 18 deaths and 42 injuries until 27 August.
Senegalese internet users have described the consequences of the floods in their regions.
Meanwhile, blogger Anna Gueye compiles the most impactful photos on social media and Claude André Coly talks about the difficulties people in other regions are experiencing:
Bolivia: Are you incinerating uranium in La Paz?
On 28 August 2012, the Bolivian authorities seized two tonnes of solid material, allegedly uranium or radioactive minerals, which were being transported without any security or protection measures from a property located in a central district of La Paz near several diplomatic posts.
The government minister Carlos Romero led the operation, carried out by special police units.
Later, Minister Romero reported that tests and analyses carried out by the laboratory determined that the material "is not radioactive.
There will be no affect".
However, Romero also announced that the National Service of Geology and Technical Mines Sergeotecmin and the Bolivian Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology will continue to investigate, so the potential radioactivity of the material is still to be clarified.
Police seized two tons of uranium in Sopocachi, La Paz, on August 28.
Photo shared via Twitpic by the Twitter user @pagina_siete
The mainstream media reported on the event immediately and covered it throughout the day.
Social media also expressed concerns and comments, including some ironic ones, with the tag #uranium.
Blogger and journalist Andres Gomez Vela commented on his Twitter account (@andrsgomezv):
@andrsgomezv: Ojo, Bolivia does not produce #uranium, where did this cargo come from?
Maybe he was in transit to another country, says Deputy Minister Perez
In addition, internet users are criticizing the precarious way in which a potentially radioactive material was first handled.
A quick tweet from Fernanda San Martin (@Fer_SanMartin) commenting on the matter prompted an immediate response from blogger and Twitter user Mario Durán (@mrduranch):
@AndrsGomezV: Some doubts #uranium: so far no expert has seen or certified it and if it was so radioactive why were they transported like sand?
Renan Justiniano (@renanjustiniano) concluded:
@renanjustiniano: If the mineral found yesterday is #uranium the first thing you should have done was to see if it was radioactive not call the press! #bolivia
Don't be afraid of the internet : An infographic
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
We've already shown you how the Internet, without freedom of expression, is not worth it; and how this right involves such simple things as choosing a domain name.
It's just that we're not always aware of free speech on the Internet, we take it for granted.
However, many of the things we do on the Internet every day depend on this right, and without freedom of expression, these practices would be compromised for various reasons: from censorship and police persecution in some countries to excesses in criminal prosecution and copyright in Chile.
Now we present a new infographic from our #NoTemasaInternet campaign, where we want to show, in very simple and educational terms, some of the things we can do on the internet thanks to your right to freedom of expression.
Visit our Tumblr and get to know the infographic in more detail.
All the links lead to pages in Hungarian.
Between 45 and 50 people live in makeshift huts in abandoned forests along Feher and Terebesi roads in Budapest, the capital of Hungary.
In June 2012, shortly before the event, the municipality of Budapest's X district asked these people to leave their homes.
Some of the residents, who have lived in these neighborhoods for decades, have built farms for their own livelihoods, while others have tried to make a living collecting and selling junk.
Several years ago, there were rumors that the city was planning to build a recreational park in the area.
Residents told atlatszo.hu journalists that Red Cross and Baptist social workers informed them of the eviction and offered to stay in their shelters.
The human rights organization A Város Mindenkié (The city is for all) criticized the forced eviction and labeled it illegal; it also said that the housing conditions they offer are worse than their current homes.

In June, the blog Kettős Mérce wrote about the news:
One after another, municipalities announce the decision to destroy the marginal neighbourhoods but do not offer alternatives to help them.
However, shelters for homeless people offered as alternatives would not give them the opportunity to lead an independent life but would integrate them into a lifelong system.
At present, there is no policy in Hungary that allows for an independent start.
That's why people build these neighborhoods and try to create them outside the state framework.
In their blog, they wrote that the municipality gave two weeks to local social workers to find a place to live for these 50 people.
They also said that shelters for homeless people were not an appropriate alternative, as homeless people can live there for up to two years and without income would have nowhere to go.
The investigation by Atlatszo.hu showed that the municipality of District X asked social workers to solve the problem to support a real estate investment.
As deputy mayor, Tibor Weber informed atlatszo.hu journalists that the investor's plans, the Sidi Group, to build 900 apartments, offices and some recreational areas are currently in an advanced phase of authorization.
Civil rights protests and increasing media attention have apparently delayed the eviction, which now appears to have become a legal and negotiated process.
Many of the residents have already gone to shelters, others still remain in slums, but for now the process is on its way.
Venezuela: Is a natural disaster looming in Mata Redonda?
The residents of Mata Redonda, in the Venezuelan city of Maracay, have joined the media to denounce a possible natural disaster if the containment wall that separates the area from Lake Valencia collapses.
The discussion began with the publication of a video on YouTube and its expansion through Twitter and Facebook.
This resumed the problem of pollution of the Valencia lake and insufficient sanitation works.
Several videos have been shared in recent days that point to the possibility of an environmental disaster, and possible solutions or prevention measures have been discussed.
Many families worry about not having a place to hide in the event of a flood, and others turn on alarms without feeling cared for.
User Ruckyto posted the video in question:
Romualdo Hostos, for his part, filmed the effect of the rains in the area weeks ago:
Host commented:
On the night of August 14 after a torrential rainfall in Maracay Edo Aragua, in the Urb Mata Round the Rio Madre Vieja Lindero of the Applesa 29 of the urbanization floods through the houses of the applesauce putting in the community, waiting for the environment ministry to execute the sentence of the TSJ.
The allegations continue on Twitter, where many also wonder if Venezuela is waiting for another tragedy like Amuay's.
Sonia Guanipa (@soniaguanipar) says:
Attention, this video taken today shows the next tragedy that will happen.
The Redwood Forest containment wall is about to collapse, and the water is more than 2 meters above street level.
As soon as the wall breaks, the whole area floods without anyone knowing what the damage will be.
Bolivia: Former minister demands clarification of repression via Facebook
The young minister left the cabinet of President Evo Morales hours after the news of the violent police intervention at the VIII Indigenous march in defense of the Indigenous Territory and Isiboro Sécure National Park (TIPNIS) was circulated on September 25, 2011.
Chacon issued this note just as Sacha Llorenti, a former government minister, was appointed permanent ambassador to the United Nations (UN) in New York.
During the police intervention of the VIII Indigenous March, Llorenti served as head of the police and direct authority responsible for security.
Note by Maria Cecilia Chacón on Facebook
Among the highlights of her note, former minister Chacon points out:
It has been almost a year since the shameful repression in Chaparina, that day of violence against women, children.
What is really important?
Who prepared the plan?
Who proposed it?
Who authorized it?
Who executed him?
Who applauded the clean and casual execution?
It matters everything we saw, but much more what we didn't see.
He adds:
The process of change is not a monopoly of a party or an elite of enlightened people.
No one should be considered an "invited" to the process, just as no one can think of himself as more important than another partner.
We were strong because we were all together, side by side.
Fausto, an anonymous user, commented on the blog Rimay Pampa:
This letter is the most honest, clear, incisive, courageous, equitable, mature pronunciation; without rhetoric or figures or pseudo-intelligent requests.
He worked correctly by stepping down from office to keep his ethics, and principles intact.
We thank you very much for expressing diaphaneally what the rest of the conscious Bolivians would have liked to have expressed.
On the other hand, there were also criticisms of the note.
Rocio Llobet (@rociolloret) comments through his Twitter account:
@rociolloret: So wise was former minister Chacon, she knew the opposition was going to use her letter, when the underlying problem is another
While Ingrid Barrientos comments in the same note posted on Facebook:
You are not alone, your courage, it is the courage of many of us, your courage, we have shown it, and we will continue to do it, the Dignity impetus you have given, is an important point, we are neither right nor left, if we want a change for our Bolivia that starts from ourselves!!
China: Hulunbuir grasslands destroyed by coal mining
The Hulunbuir meadows, located in northwestern Inner Mongolia, provide a beautiful setting of vast pastures, forests, rivers and lakes where Mongolian shepherds raise sheep and cattle.
It's also a very tourist spot.
But as a result of mining activities near the surface, the meadows are eroding at a rapid rate.

Peru: Activists start a "civic crusade" for the defence of the Nanay River
This is the second part of a three-part series on water issues in the city of Iquitos.
See the first one.
In the previous post we briefly introduced the water problem in Iquitos, and then we exposed the controversy generated by the exploration and search for hydrocarbons by the multinational Conoco Phillips in the Nanay River basin.
Continuing with the topic, not long ago researcher Gonzalo Tello reflected on the performance of Conoco Phillips in his article "El Agua Sagrada":
The main problem is that the C P is an environmental flatter with a license of course granted by the TLC with the US in the sense that, as the concessions have already been given to them, with the terms of reference of an operations plan approved by the Peruvian government (although it has several serious holes under the environmental floating line, for which History should punish at least morally those responsible), this oil consortium is  blinded  by said TLC to execute, yes or yes, its plans, at any cost, without anyone from the government opposing them, under legal penalty in force of the binational instrument.

As for the Loreto Regional Government's action on this issue, Darrin Mortenson comments in an article by Alianza Arkana:
The issue has been a political taboo since US extractor ConocoPhillips, secretly moved to the region two years ago, despite Loreto Regional Government laws banning industrial production at the Nanay River's source.
Despite the laws, the government has been complacent with ConocoPhillips at all times since 2010.
Regarding the legal efforts the Water Committee in Iquitos is making to force the publication of the impact studies, it adds:
The results will be displayed as long as ConocoPhillips officials believe they have found oil and will finally present the scope of the project to experts, activists and the general public - something the regional government has been desperately, but apparently illegally, trying to avoid.
Not only does the Regional Government have a controversial role in these events; according to the weekly La Verdad de Iquitos, it is laughable that the Management Committee of the affected area is chaired by "Perúpetro (the one who gave the concession) and has as vice-president the representative of Conoco Phillips,
The Commission of Andean, Amazonian, Afroperuan, Environment and Ecology of the Congress of the Republic announced that it will hold a decentralized session in Iquitos to analyze the problematic issues generated by the operations of ConocoPhillips in the Nanay River basin.
Given the limited resources the Committee manages, they organized a cebichada to pay some of the commission's expenses in Lima.
This activity took place on September 15 at the San Agustin school.
Elizabeth Lozano, spokeswoman for the Amazon Collective, said: "We call on the citizens who feel committed to the environment and its importance for the future of the Amazon to support us by buying a ten-sun ticket equivalent to a plate of Zungary cebiche from Nanay, the last ones in the area who would survive if we allow high-impact activities to take place in their spawning habitat.
On September 15, the Water Committee met with a Conoco Phillips shareholder in Iquitos, who was reiterated as a defence of the Nanay basin and demanded that all oil activity in the area be stopped.
Seamus Finn, Conoco Phillips' shareholder, took note of the above and stated that he would present it at the company's next shareholders meeting in New York City on October 5.
It is to be expected what results will be seen from the activities of the representatives of the Water Committee in Lima, from 24 to 27 September.

Peru: Monocultures endanger the water in Iquitos
This is the third and final part of a three-part series on water issues in the city of Iquitos.
See the first and second.
In the first post of this series we introduce the water problem in Iquitos and the controversy generated by the exploration and search for hydrocarbons by the multinational Conoco Phillips in the Nanay River basin.
In the second post we delve deeper into the Conoco Phillips case, also showing the actions that organizations like the Water Committee are taking to protect the river and the water supply for Iquitos.
In this third and final post, we focus on monocultures in the Nanay River and the controversy that causes the issue between those who support these types of crops and those who advise against them.
This water struggle in Iquitos is not without risks.
The researcher at the IIAP (Peruvian Amazon Research Institute), José Álvarez, published an article entitled "Monocultures in the Nanay?
No, thanks", where he pointed out the reasons of the IIAP to discourage the cultivation of oil palm in the Nanay basin, especially in the Curaca breakwater basin, a tributary of the Nanay, adjacent to the buffer area of the Allpahuayo-Mishana National Reserve.
- The Nanay basin is the source of drinking water for the population of Iquitos and surrounding towns, and any serious alteration of plant cover can put at risk the provision of this vital element, both in quantity and quality.
Industrial palm plantations, in addition to the cutting of large areas of native forests, require high inputs of agrochemicals and therefore pose a serious threat of water pollution. - The areas where palm plantations are planned are entirely covered by very little altered primary forests, which have barely undergone any selective extraction of some woodland and wildlife species.
It is the policy of the Peruvian State, and a formal commitment to the international community, to protect the Amazon primary forests, as a measure to reduce carbon emissions and to contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change.

Published under Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) But this apparently did not suit the taste of some, who organized a group of people, allegedly peasants  from the area, who went out to demonstrate in favor of the cultivation of the  oil palm  and at the same time attacking researcher José Álvarez, carrying banners where you could read things like  natural resource traffickers  and asked for their expulsion from the national territory.
In a statement backing the researcher, a group of citizens from Iquitos said they had been informed that Álvarez "was the culprit for not promoting palm cultivation and not approving government credits for this purpose", suggesting that the origin of these attacks would be close to regional authorities.
Not all opinions are against the cultivation of oil palm in the Nanay basin.The economist Victor Villavicencio la Torre, who served as Regional Manager of Economic Development of the Loreto Regional Government, is in favour and writes:
It is imperative that a regional policy position be adopted or fixed on the promotion and promotion of a crop which, having proved to be highly profitable, can be an alternative to lifting hundreds or thousands of farmers out of poverty, post-production and misery through the partnership between the State and productive investment.
This alliance must take those NGOs out of the political game who receive and manage money from countries that, let us say, are the first to attack the environment and biodiversity of many nations in the world.
He then reiterates what he thinks the role of the state should be:
The State must set itself as an immediate goal to review the laws governing agricultural and forestry activities, to pull the progres  flags that display these  caviar  from the environment and stop being passive spectators of the aggressive actions they develop.... we find a convergence point that prevents the rural people, tired of so many promises of change, from ending up burning the prairie and bringing to the collective memory the tragic events of Cajamarca, Espinar, Mother of God and Bagua.
Is that what we want?
In response, the aforementioned researcher Biologist José Álvarez published another article entitled "Chronic Underdevelopment" where he argues the following:
They say conservationists have spent tens of millions on projects funded by foreign tortoises that seek to curb the development of our region.
The big question: did anyone prevent agriculture and livestock from being promoted in the jungle for these years, without restrictions, in the communities of Loreto?
- No, I'm not.
But entrepreneurs are still very interested in the business opportunities representing the 620,00 hectares of the Loreto region, which according to the Ministry of Agriculture are available for sowing, and are doing dissemination work on this.
Moreover, academics and researchers continue to provide data and studies on the danger that oil palm cultivation poses to the fragile Amazon ecosystem.
They even denounce that companies are promoting the consideration of oil palm plantations as reforestation activities, as well as the incentives the government gives to such cultivation.
Even President Ollanta Humala in a recent press conference mentioned an Amazon area, the Alto Huallaga, as having "potential for agribusiness, for coffee, for cocoa, for oil palm for planting fruit trees".
On the one hand, there are those who promote large-scale investments and on the other, those who defend the environment, exacerbating the problem by the fact that dialogue on this issue is not something that is precisely abundant, as is clear and transparent information that citizens need.

On Thursday, September 20, 2012, Mexico's elected president, Enrique Peña Nieto, began his visit to Chile, the fourth country within his first tour of Central and South American nations.
After a private dinner with President Sebastián Piñera, he held a meeting with Chile's top businessmen on Friday morning and later made an official visit to the Monetary Palace.
Peña Nieto thanked the hospitality through his Twitter account (@EPN):
@EPN: I thank President @sebastianpinera for his hospitality and the productive meeting.
Our relationship with Chile will remain strategic.
Members of #YoSoy132-Chile denounced the arrest of six of their colleagues  one of them of Mexican origin  for protesting in La Moneda Square against the visit of the elected president.
Mexican cybernetics responded to this label, generating an exchange that led to the label becoming a trendy topic.
Here are some of them:
The Chilean Max Barata (@MaxBarata) commented with humor:
Image shared by @YoSoy132chile on Twitter
@MaxBarata: Piñera and Peña Nieto.
Lex Luthor and Darth Vader are missing and we're putting "Cummit" on him.
While Chascas Valenzuela (@elchascas) imagined the meeting between the two leaders:
@elchascas: A dialogue between Peña Nieto and Piñera should be like a sketch of humor.
Both talking about poverty, helicopters and golf at the same time.
The parody account of journalist Carmen Aristegui (@Aristegui_CNN) sentenced:
@Aristegui_CNN: #VetedeChilePeñaNieto No!
Let him stay there!
From Mexico, the Committee on Legal and Human Rights 132 (@ComiteDH132) made this comparison:
@ComiteDH132: If anything, the only difference between Pinochetism and Priism is that here, indeed, the dictatorship was perfect... #VeteDeChilePeñaNieto
While Gaby (@Gigi_091) denounced:
@Gigi_091: The protests in Chile against Peña Nieto Are not news Televisa? but if it is news a power outage in the Chamber of Deputies...
And Enrique J. Bautista (@kmach02) from Tabasco, Mexico spoke about the union that some internet users from both countries felt through this online protest:
@kmach02: #VetedeChilePeñaNieto and that day Chile and Mexico felt more brothers than ever... they fighting for education and we for Taxation

10 things you shouldn't prevent because of copyright (infographic)
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
In the digital world, where barriers to access to information, knowledge and culture have declined markedly, intellectual property can become an obstacle to freedom of expression (we explain this here, and we saw it, for example, in the testimony of Intelligent Citizen).
In this new infographic, we want to be explicit in that you know 10 of the common things we do on the Internet that should not be blocked by intellectual property.
The problem is that, as absurd as it may seem, many of them are common targets for certain particular interests of the copyright industry.
Know your rights, soldier them and defend them.
In that way, you're also defending the Internet. #NoTemasaInternet

China: Protesters arrested for human rights banners in protest against Japan
More and more people believe that the weekend of anti-Japan protests in more than 80 cities are state-sponsored.
The arrest of three peaceful protesters in Shenzhen among thousands of anti-Japanese protesters demonstrates how effectively and selectively the police were controlling and directing the demonstration.
According to the NGO's news website canyu.org, three human rights activists were arrested on September 16 this year during the demonstration against Japan:
(News from Canyu last September 16) This morning the great demonstration against Japan took place in the center of Shenzhen near Huaqiang North and the Citizen Center.
Shenzhen Democrats such as Jiang Weidong, Ziyuan dared to express their aspirations for freedom, democracy and human rights. They joined the demonstration holding a banner with the words: Freedom, Democracy, Human Rights and Constitutional norms.
They were discovered by the secret police and detained around 1 p.m.
Since then, they've been out of touch, their phones are off.
Our contact phone number is 15167233712
Three Shenzhen human rights activists, who were quickly arrested by the secret police, protested in favor of democracy in a protest against Japan.
Photos from canyu.com
The above data somehow echoes C. Custers' remarks about the role of the police in the protest against Japan:
Like many people around the world, I've spent the last few days looking at photos and reports of anti-Japanese demonstrations in China.
For those interested, here's an excellent collection of them.
For those who have been to a demonstration in China before, they will tend to say: Where are the despicable police officers?
Now, we'll compare photos of the Beijing "Jazmine Revolution" protest, an incident so small that not only were there no car-turn, fire or riots, but there were even no protesters.
There was an army of cops there...
It is overwhelming evidence that China is ignoring these protests.
China's absence of police forces is clearly evident, especially in contrast to the large number circulating and starting to jump in front of the destroyed lenses and cameras every time an unforeseen protest displeases the Chinese government.
China has clearly shown that, if it wants to, it is very capable of keeping a protest against Japan under control.
The obvious conclusion  the only conclusion now  is that you don't want it.
Paraguay: Internet providers block without authorization news site
Cyber clubs in Paraguay.

An alarming act of censorship by private companies took place on September 26 last in Paraguay.
Two Internet Service Providers (ISPs) blocked the AbcColor.me website without a court order
Clarification from AbcColor.me
The controversial website is a user-friendly platform that generates content similar to the local ABC Color newspaper.
Any user can upload news (fake news and satire are welcome) as well as photos related to the news.
Once the content is uploaded the appearance of the article resembles that of the ABC Color newspaper, but it has a footnote clarification that the site contains fake news and user-created content.
TEDIC reported on the situation and criticized the move by ISPs as a violation of consumer rights and an act against the principles of net neutrality and consumer rights.
When users attempted to access the site from the Tigo Internet service provider they received a warning informing them that they were being redirected since the company had classified the site as containing malicious software and therefore simply denied access.
He was also blocked from cell phones.
After internet users were outraged and annoyed by this clear act of censorship by a private company, increased pressure on Twitter and even the Argentine Pirate Party expressed concern, Internet service providers unblocked the website.
Tigo Paraguay did not apologize or give explanations to users, they simply unblocked the site.
With the presidential elections approaching next April 2013, and after the accusation of former President Lugo online free speech is a sensitive and vulnerable issue in a highly divided country where political instability concerns many.
Now Paraguayan citizens know that their Internet service providers have the technology to quickly censor sites and are eager to do so.
As consumers and citizens they should ask themselves all sorts of questions.

The following is the list of the countries of the European Union:
On October 2, as part of the International Day of Nonviolence, several Colombians decided to call on other citizens to celebrate 24-0, an initiative that seeks to ensure that no violent deaths occur on that day.
José Ignacio Navas explains the origin of the celebration of the International Day of Nonviolence:
With a 24-hour campaign without violent deaths, Colombians celebrate the International Day of Nonviolence, which is held every October 2 as established by the United Nations.
In this way, the international organization commemorates the birth of the pacifist leader Mahatma Gandhi, who led the Indian independence movement and was "a pioneer of the philosophy and strategy of nonviolence".
While the initiative's website describes the day's goal: 0 violent deaths on October 2:
Notice 24-0
"Our goal is 0 violent deaths because we have already done it, 0 violent deaths in 24 hours if possible.
What do we want to be the figure in 2012?
Several citizens shared on Twitter what was happening in real time and expressed optimism about the initiative.
Musician César López (@CesarLopezmusic), one of the leaders of the initiative, posted:
@CesarLopezmusic: Our children can say a lot about us but never that we don't try. @24_0 @24_0Guatemala @240puertorico
Actress Carolina Guerra (@carolinaguerram) expressed her wish:
@TutiFurlan: Today, before I demand #Peace I must check if I am giving it, if I am living it, if I am promoting it in every step I take! @24_0
In the city of Bogotá, an event was held with the participation of several national and international musicians and artists that was followed via streaming.

Venezuela: Capriles closed his campaign with a mass demonstration in Caracas
On Sunday, September 30, supporters of Henrique Capriles demonstrated in the streets of Caracas during the closure of the presidential candidate's campaign.
Capriles is running against current President Hugo Chávez in the upcoming presidential election on October 7.
Daniel Duquenal wrote on his Venezuela News and Views blog:
I'm not ready to put "political event" because some confused revolutions could lead to lots of people taking to the streets.
I can assure you something, from previous experiences in Venezuela, today Capriles has put at least a million and a half people on the streets of Caracas.
Libertador, Solano, Miranda, San Martin avenues were crowded, and more, for hours.

Venezuela: Twitter manual for citizen election coverage
Reporte Ya (@reporteya), a training initiative by the Miguel Otero Silva Foundation, has released a manual on Twitter use for citizens reporting during the upcoming presidential elections in Venezuela on October 7, 2012.
The manual is available online in PDF format on the website of the newspaper El Nacional.
The manual - written by journalist, blogger, and Global Voices contributor Luis Carlos Díaz - states:
On election day, social media will be a reflection of our participatory spirit, but it will also serve to keep track of what happens in almost every corner of the country.
It is therefore important to have some criteria for covering and monitoring the elections.
The aim of this manual is to provide some premises to reduce noise and rumors, produce reliable information and connect to networks for citizen reporting.
Twitter handbook for citizen election coverage
The manual is based on questions like "Why will we use Twitter?", "How do I upload photos/videos to Twitter?", "How do I monitor information during elections?", "How do I avoid rumors?" and more.
The manual also instructs citizens to report on communications failures, listing three possible scenarios: collapse of mobile networks, collapse of the Twitter platform, and blocking of internet access.
To answer the question "What #tag will we use?", the manual recommends using #7O or #ElectionsVE, "although they will change throughout the day depending on Twitter users' discussions and reactions to election events".

Turkey: Thousands protest in Istanbul against war with Syria
The Turkish army attacked Syrian targets in response to the killing of five Turkish civilians by Syrian government forces.
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's office issued a statement immediately afterwards, saying:
Our armed forces in the border region immediately responded to this abominable attack in accordance with their rules of engagement; targets were hit by artillery fire against radar-identified locations in Syria.
The Turkish parliament approved a one-year mandate authorising cross-border military action.
The motion was approved by 320 votes in the 550-seat Turkish parliament.
The Turkish Deputy Prime Minister has said in a statement that authorising the use of force in Syria does not amount to a declaration of war, but acts as a preventive measure.
This was followed by a statement by the Turkish Prime Minister which said:
All we want in this region is peace and security.
We have no intention of starting a war.
We are aware of the results, the consequences, of the war in Iraq and Afghanistan... we see the same in Syria.
The Syrian state news agency (SANA) immediately issued a statement saying that the Syrian authorities offered their deepest condolences to the families of the dead and the Turkish people.
More than 5,000 protesters took to the streets of Istanbul against a possible war with Syria.
On Thursday night, the demonstration was against the AKP, and the protesters chanted,
The AKP wants war, the people want peace.
Not to war, peace now.
A poster in Istanbul's anti-war protest saying No to intervention in Syria, shared by @Cherine_89 on Twitter.

In Turkey, the slogan Savasa hayir, meaning "no to war", became the top trending topic among Twitter users on Thursday morning.
And since the mandate for cross-border military action has been passed, social media has been divided on the issue, creating a firestorm of views from activists, experts and the like.
From Turkey, Hulya Ataoglu tweeted:
@cramelin: #savasahayir #notowar No to war, not now and never.
Ozgur Gurbuz from Istanbul says:
@ozzgurbuz: Peace is the only way #noWar #savasahayir from Istanbul.
More and more here.

Costa Rica: Advances in wildlife protection laws
On October 10, 2012, President Laura Chinchilla signed a decree strengthening controls against fleeting in the region.
Although finishing in Costa Rica has been banned since 2001, some gaps in current legislation allowed the marketing of shark fins.
The purpose of the decree is to legalize the importation of shark fins into the country to prevent their sale and export.
The news was received with great joy by ecologists, non-governmental organizations and hundreds of citizens who had sent letters to the Republic's Executive Power to raise awareness about a terrible and painful practice.
This is what Carol Corrales says in a post she wrote for Rainforest Radio:
Shark finishing is a devastating and cruel practice, where sharks are mutilated to extract their fins, and then returned to the sea without them, where the animal dies after suffering a terrible agony.

Favorable comments about the signing were made visible on Twitter under the tag #NOALALETEO.
Such is the case of Marianela Castro (@necascru) who tweeted:
@necascru: #noalaleteo Zero tolerance to flaunting!
Up the creatures of our seas!
Free life to our biodiversity! #CR
But this is not the only good news for Costa Ricans regarding wildlife protection.
On 2 October, the legislature approved the conservation law on the abolition of sport hunting in the country.
The project was promoted by the Association for the Preservation of Flora and Fauna (Apreflofas) and if approved in a second debate, Costa Rica would be the first nation in Latin America to penalize this practice.
This project was supported by citizens who with over 177 thousand signatures constituted an important defense for the law.
Under the slogan Cazar es Matar  a large number of supporters were mobilized for the popular initiative that is the first nationwide to reach the Congress.
The blog Generation Rebel  describes the event as  a celebration for wildlife  and concludes a post about the news with the following sentence:
We celebrate it.
And we are prepared to be vigilant that any attempt to repeal it be thrown out and that it be carried out in full.
The congressmen who opposed the law in the first debate received strong criticism.
This is what Susan wrote on Maecr's blog:
In Costa Rica, killing wild animals to eat? In the Stone Age perhaps. the matter of sport hunting and its interests, is one that among searched words he probably tries to hide.
Elections are coming up, most people may not feel so close, but it's important to think and decide well who we give power to, which subjects are going to sit comfortably, with good salaries to choose and decide for ALL the others.

Chile: I'm in Dicom : new video on copyright
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
English translator's note: Dicom is a credit reporting agency in Chile owned by Equifax.
The phrase "I am in Dicom" is commonly used by Chileans to indicate that they have a debt report.
The case of the film I'm in Dicom  is highly illustrative to talk about how intellectual property can affect freedom of expression, bringing together two at least curious legal actions: on the one hand, Equifax, the company that owns Dicom, is trying to revoke the domain estoyendicom.cl, because the film would be taking customers away from its product.
And on the other hand, according to this company, I'm in Dicom  would already exist, as it would be the name of a literary work that was previously inscribed by an Equifax worker.
Both actions, of course, pursued at all costs to inhibit the development and premiere of the work.
In this new video from #NoTemasaInternet, the filmmakers of I'm in Dicom  tell us why they're not afraid of the Internet, describing these legal actions and how, despite Equifax's attempts, they're confident that their right to freedom of expression will prevail over the copyright reasons brought forward in the case.
Bahrain: Four Twitter users arrested
According to Bahrain's Interior Ministry, "four tweets have been detained for social media abuse".
However, the charges mentioned in the report seem imprecise: defamation of public figures on social media.
The tweets Ali Al-Haiki, Abdullah Al-Hashimi, Ali Mohamed and Salman Abdullah will be in custody for the seven days of the investigation.
Although the Bahraini authorities claim that the Constitution protects freedom of expression, there have been cases where activists are detained solely for exercising their right to expression on social media such as Twitter.
If the four detainees are arrested for exercising their right to freedom of expression they should be considered prisoners of conscience.
Updates will be published later.
Panama: President Martinelli addresses the country after repealing Law 72
Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli tried to close a chaotic week with a conciliatory speech calling for peace after the fierce clashes in Columbus in protest against Law 72.
The law allowed the sale of land located in the free zone (of taxes) of Columbus.
The press conference was broadcast on national television on Sunday, October 28, before a crowd waiting to see what the first president could say after a silence interrupted only by two tweeted clicks.
Telemetro summarizes some phrases from the presidential speech:
"I have a sad heart, for the lost lives, the wounded, and the looted property, sad because instead of moving forward we retreated" were part of the words of the president who expressed that a law was repealed whose explanation did not reach everyone.
He stressed that "violence should never be the way to resolve our differences, for the good of the country and the Panamanians, these confrontations cannot be
During the speech, some Panamanians demanded the resignation of the president on social media, some mocked the absence of apologies, and others saw a real opportunity for peace.
For El Joe (@hilmerj28), for example, the president taught his opponents a lesson by delivering a conciliatory message to Panamanians:
@hilmerj28: "@gonzalezbmariac: Good message @rmartinelli I show conciliatory message Panama and the colonists!" sad opposing lizards don't you think?
But for others like Zeus Delgarte (@ZeusDelgarte) the speech was too brief:
@ZeusDelgarte: I should have done twettcam RENUNCY MARTINELLI lying
The minister of the presidency Roberto Henriquez (@RCHENRIQUEZ) sees in the speech sincerity and the opportunity for reconciliation:
@RCHENRIQUEZ: Law 72 repealed.
Martinelli, you know what?
Now we're going to arrange dialogue with Columbus's living forces.
Opposition MP Beby Valderrama (@BebyValderrama) believes the speech is simply an opportunity to clear the government's face and not ask for forgiveness:
@BebyValderrama: 9 days, 192 hours, 11,520 minutes and 691,200 seconds 4 dead, + of 42 wounded and in 5 min he intends to praise everyone and does not ask forgiveness
While the speech called for reconciliation, social media reactions have been mixed and met.
Perhaps this is not the last chapter of this controversial law.

Libya: Is it true that Khamis Gaddafi is dead?
This article is part of our special coverage of the 2011 Libyan Revolution.
Is Khamis Gaddafi dead?
Really dead?
The journalist Mary Fitzgerald tweeted:
@MaryFitzgeraldIT: After a day of rumors, the spokesman for the Libyan National Congress has stated on a local TV channel that Khamis, Gaddafi's son, had been captured and wounded and died today
@MaryFitzgeraldIT: Given that Khamis, Gaddafi's son has been reported kidnapped or killed on different occasions over the past 20 months, it's not surprising that many wait to see the evidence #Libya
The Libyan Youth Movement said:
@ShababLibya: We will wait until we see photos and keep you updated about it.
We all thought he was dead already! #Libya
And Huda adds:
@hudduh: Khamis has died more times than Kenny.
Waiting for the inevitable video confirming his capture/death. #Libya
NPR strategist Andy Carvin tweeted:
@acarvin: Show us Khamis Gaddafri.
Try it.
Until then, he will remain a Kayser Soze. #Libya
Meanwhile, Iyad El-Baghdadi predicted:
@iyad_elbaghdadi: Some despicable person has created and circulated a photoshop-repeated image of Khamis dead #Gaddafi in 3...
2... #Libya
And from Libya, AletheiaLibya commented:
@AletheiaLibya: If #Gaddafi "lives forever in the hearts of Libyans", it is fair that Moussa Ibrahim and Khamis also live forever in the #prisons of Libya
Moussa Ibrahim was the spokesman for Gaddafi.
News reports say he was captured in Tarhouna, south of the capital, Tripoli.
Journalist Jenan Moussa called for reason:
@jenanmoussa: Guys, guys, stop spreading rumors.
I confirm that nobody in #Libya can confirm anything for the moment about Khamis Gaddafi
Only time will tell if Khamis Gaddafi will soon get the same fate as his father

The destruction of Syria in photos
This post is part of our special coverage of the 2011/12 Syrian protests.
Syrian photographers from around the world are revealing, sharing and storing the uprising in Syria through photographs showing the destruction.
Although the media is limited, what is coming out of Syria shows the terrible reality that Syrians face when they see their country being literally destroyed.
Although there are no reliable sources confirming the locations of the photographs or the number of victims, the following images are a sample to get an idea of how Syria's infrastructure and residential areas have been affected.
Among hundreds of photographers, Yazan Homsy shares with us scenes of the destruction of Homs.
He describes himself as:
@YazanHomsY: Yazan Homsy, son of the great Homs, activist of the Syrian revolution, from the Khalidya neighborhood.
Revolution to victory or martyrdom.
He has posted his images on his Facebook page to illustrate the destruction of buildings in the city of Homs.

Bolivia: Vice President follows the trail of insults from internet users
"I frequently connect and point out the names and surnames of those who insult the president (Evo Morales)", said Álvaro García Linera, vice president of Bolivia, on October 20, 2012.
Although opposition members considered this comment an attempt to restrict freedom of expression in the country, the government minister, Carlos Romero, asserted that "normally there is an erroneous use of social networks to attack the government or to give erroneous information about its work".
Internet users had different reactions to this news.
The tweeter Juan Carlos Quiroga (@jcrquiroga) highlighted the positive side of the vice president's comment:
The Vice President of Bolivia, Álvaro García Linera, during a meeting of UNASUR in February 2010.

@jcrquiroga: I liked the Vice talking about the networks, because for the first time we know he is interested in social networks. @joup1
However, Mr. García Linera does not have an official website, user profile or Facebook or Twitter account, the two most popular social networks in Bolivia.
Mario Durán (@mrduranch), a Twitter user from El Alto, Bolivia, also hinted that the government is not aware of the situation:
@mrduranch: the blue idea (referring to the ruling party, MAS) to monitor social media allows "bad things"... with that logic we should eliminate kitchen knives #fb
Other internet users are asking the government to address the problems and needs of Bolivians.
Fabiola Chambi (@fabiolachambi) commented on her Twitter:
@fabiolachamb: Let Vice and his "trackers" write down the complaints and needs of the internet users.
There are other spaces where the people manifest!
The vice president's comments and the reactions of citizens (both inside and outside the Internet) have revived the debate over social media control in Bolivia.
On the Facebook page of Democratic Governance, a platform focused on expanding democratic exchange in the country, Miriam Romero Baldiviezo expressed her support for restrictive measures, especially to solve problems such as pornography and crime, as well as to legislate on Internet use and access.
In response to Miriam Romero's comment, some activists consider such control measures unfeasible due to a number of restrictions; for example, most Bolivians connect to the Internet from cafes and other public spaces, so the same IP address is assigned to different users.
Bolivia: Radio journalists burned in Yacuiba
Bolivian radio journalist Fernando Vidal and radio technician Karen Arce of Popular Radio in Yacuiba, a city on the Bolivian border with Argentina, were attacked by four mascots on Monday, October 29, 2012.
The men threw oil bombs inside the station, poured gasoline on Vidal and set him on fire.
Arce was also wounded in the attack.
Vidal, manager and owner of the radio station, and Arce are being treated for their burns as the investigation into the arson attack progresses.
Early theories suggest that the attack may have been related to Vidal's open criticism of corruption and smuggling.
Vidal's son-in-law, journalist Esteban Farfán Romero, has been actively reporting on the journalist's health status and the news of the case.
On Monday, October 29, Farfan reported on Facebook:
We're working to rebuild the Radio.
Right now we're taking out all the burnt stuff to get back in the air as don Fernando Vidal told us before we left for Santa Cruz.
That's how I got the radio after the bombing.
On October 31, Farfan (@EstebanFarfanR) tweeted the latest report on the arrests:
Vidal believes two government officials from Tarija department are behind the attack.
The Minister of the Interior, Carlos Romero, supports the theory.
The attack was clearly designed to stop Vidal's program, which that day was dedicated to discussing local smuggling cases.
Farfan confirmed that the family shares this theory on their Facebook account.
The Reporters Without Borders article adds:
As former mayor of Yacuiba and municipal councillor, Vidal has never hesitated to denounce corruption in Tarija's department and has always criticized the way public funds have been handled at national and regional levels, where they have increased significantly now that the Chaco region is earning more than 100 million dollars a year from the sale of its natural gas.
The Bolivian government, the United Nations and several media organizations have condemned the attack.
Farfan also reports that Yacuiba citizens marched to demand justice and shared photos of the march on Twitter:

Puerto Rico: Another way to look up
Enrique Arce, a Puerto Rican street artist and photographer, known as Aslan, has been posting photos of planes on his Instagram account for more than six months as part of his #upstairs series.
The project aims to engage with the community through the "Scavenger Hunt" challenge detailed in their blog.
Selections from the series are printed and pasted on tiles and then nailed to the walls and buildings throughout San Juan.
The lucky ones who find those tiles first and send a photo to Aslan with their location, earn a copy of the tile they can keep.
In a recent interview published by Global Voices, Aslan says: "I started meeting at the beginning without a clear motive.
It wasn't until I decided to work on the series that I realized that this exploration could lead to a different kind of artistic creation that could draw attention.
It's interesting to see how simple ideas like looking up (or "up") and photographing an airplane are what attract more people".
Below you will find ten of my favorite photos of planes from the giant #upstairs series - which has over 600 photographs to date!
The photographs are reproduced with the permission of the artist.
Follow Aslan as he continues to collect more photos through Twitter and his blog.
The following paintings belong to Aslan's collection of creatures in limbo, presented here to show some of the artist's other work.

Arab world: Obama and Romney share views on Syria
After waiting until late in the morning to tune in to the latest US presidential debate (before the November elections) between President Obama and Republican hopeful Mitt Romney, Arab internet users ended up sharing a series of harsh comments on the network.
On Twitter, netizens lashed out at US policy regarding Syria by saying that both Obama and Romney were the two sides of the same coin.
Abu Hatem tweeted:
@abuhatem: As far as Syria is concerned, Romney and Obama are exactly the same.
Ahmed Shihab-Eldin added:
@ASE: He has no different ideas, so we're doing exactly what we're supposed to do. #Obama shares Romney's plans for #Syria #Debate
What is Obama's position on Syria?
Shared through the Facebook page "The New Syria"
And the Facebook page of "The New Syria" said:
It seems as if Obama and Romney are more concerned that Syria will eventually become an "allied" of the United States than trying to help civilians there.
We don't need your help, Allah is on our side.
"THE 47th" wrote:
@THE_47th: So Obama wants to see what Israel wants to do in Syria (with or without intervention).
Romney thinks Syria is an opportunity.
30,000 dead is an opportunity.
At the same time, Syrian Amal Hanano addressed Obama:
@AmalHanano: Obama, you don't need to visit the Holocaust Museum to remember the devil.
Put on YouTube and watch the blood of #Syria.
Sami Ben Romdhane from Tunisia tweeted:
@THE_47th: The winner today has been undoubtedly Twitter.
Continuing the controversy, Tunisian blogger Ahmed Medien added:
As someone who might be affected by the same kind of policies and corporations between the US and MENA, I wasn't particularly impressed.

Ecuador struggles against sporting violence
'Guayaquil without sporting violence' is the name of a campaign that seeks to eradicate violence in football and stadiums, after last November 4 there was a confrontation between fans of Barcelona and Emelec (both professional football teams and protagonists of the "Classic of the Astillero"), leaving as balance the death of the 20-year-old George Murillo Leónde.
National and international media covered the confrontation.
Representatives from the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Sport, Ecuadorian Football Federation (FEF), National Assembly, and the Emelec and Barcelona clubs have begun working to neutralize acts of violence generated by fans and supporters of top-tier football teams.
After reaching an agreement, the parties have made "The Ten Commandments Against Violence in Football" public on the website of the Ministry of Interior.

Through social media, under the tag #NoMasViolencia, people from different parts of the country express their concern about sporting violence.
Football fans, such as @michael_cse and @Sandtolo, reject aggression and violence:
@michael_cse: For passion for the team you not only kill a citizen KILL A FAMILY and fight the country #NoMasViolence #Let's Make a Difference..
@Sandtolo: I reject violence in all its forms, violence only comes from despotism and self-centeredness:) #nomasviolence
Similarly, user @ANDRESL9 says:
@ANDRESL9: Football is a party we must live in peace. #nonviolence in stadiums.

Authorities and citizens expect new proposals like 'Guayaquil without sporting violence' to reach schools, marginal areas, and even mobile hospitals and clinics, as football is one of the few sports that moves masses across the country, especially in cities like Quito and Guayaquil.

The Gangnam Style of the Marines
A group of Marines from the U.S. Naval Academy sing the theme of Psy galloping in their white uniforms.

Blogging the aftermath of the earthquake from Huitán, Guatemala
Rural communities in Guatemala were severely affected by the strong 7.4 magnitude earthquake that struck the country's Pacific coast on November 7, 2012.
The blog of the Mi Nuevo Mundo Community Library - part of the Xela Civic Libraries project of Rising Voices, located in Huitán municipality of Quetzaltenango department - has been sharing photos and reports of the impact of the earthquake on families living in this rural area of Guatemala.
In a blog post published on November 10, community librarian Roman Díaz Castañón reported that several houses collapsed and several families were left homeless in an area called Huitancito in Huitanán:
families are crying over this disaster, they are in extreme poverty and they are going through an alarming situation, they have not received aid from institutions like food, food, we need your help.

Two days later, Roman reported that on Sunday, November 11, the Riecken Guatemala Foundation and the community library had provided assistance to ten families affected by the Huitancito earthquake in Huitancito, Huitán.
The blog post noted that the community still needed help with food, kitchen utensils, blankets and building houses.
Roman added that 100 families were affected by the earthquake and 20 lost their homes.

Later that day, a short blog entry reported that government help had arrived on November 12.
The blog will keep readers informed about food distribution among others.

Guatemala has suffered several aftershocks since November 7, including a magnitude 6.5 earthquake.
The official death toll in the country is 42.
Bangladesh: Investigation of journalist murder turns into a farce
On that day, then Interior Minister Sahara Khatun declared that the culprit would be arrested within 48 hours.
When this deadline expired, some bloggers and journalists started a series of protests about it, but there was no progress in the investigation.
Recently there have been changes in the post of minister, with Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Almgir taking over the matter.
Sagar and Runi, the murdered couple.
Image courtesy of: Facebook page "We demand justice for Sagar-Runi" More than eight months have passed since the murder, but there has been no notable progress within the investigation.
As promised, just a day before, he announced the arrest of seven suspects.
The suspects have criminal records and have been previously arrested for murder.
A million takas (Bangladesh currency, equivalent to about €10,000) were offered by the missing doorman.
Initially, the police arrested him for questioning, but the victims' relatives say 3 people took him away and he remains missing.
Many journalists do not accept the minister's statements.
After the murder, Runi's younger brother, Nowser Roman, filed a lawsuit at Sher-e-Bangla police station.
On October 10, he posted on his Facebook page:
Thinking of myself, I'm amazed at how helpless we are!!
My family and I are very miserable... I feel sorry for myself.
And Megh, my family and all those people interviewed, my heart breaks with them, for their parents and helpless partners...
Does God not exist???
Does God not exist???
(Cited with your permission).
Nowsher Roman was present at the bloggers' protest in front of the ministry on May 15, 2012.
The mother of Sagar Sarwar, the murdered journalist, thinks the arrests are a mount and said "We just want to know the truth, we want to see the real culprits behind bars".
On April 28, 2012, some bloggers started a street painting protest over the couple's death.
Source: BDNews20.com blog
Asif Nazrul, a professor at the law department of Dhaka University, posted on his Facebook page: "We ask for justice for Sagar and Runi":
There are two conspiracy theories about this murder.
The first: they made public the great corruption within the government and that's why they were killed.
The second is that the killers are linked to the parties in power.
Who works in the background?
What was the motive for the murder?
What do the eight suspects have to do with the case and how were they identified?
I want to know all these answers.
(Published with your authorisation).
Journalist Shawkat Mahmud posted on Facebook on 26 September 2012:
Since 1971, 29 journalists have been killed (in this country).
In addition, 17 have died during this legislature.
Many journalists have been injured while working and are frequently threatened.
The government has created a cloud around the Sagar-Runi investigation.
The Interior Minister said after the murder that the killers would be jailed in 48 hours.
The Inspector General of Police said that significant progress was being made in the investigation, but police officers claim that the evidence has been destroyed.
And we're still going on with the protests.
Successful metro strike in Cairo
The subway has returned to Egypt - after a four-hour strike.
Train services, which carry up to 2 million people a day in Cairo, came to a complete halt when drivers stopped working in protest against the president of the metro board, who is accused of corruption.
Workers also demand better wages and working conditions.
On Twitter, netizens applauded the strike, giving their support to what they described as legitimate workers' demands.
Salma El Tarzi pays tribute to the metro workers for the success of the strike.
He writes:
@Salma_El_Tarzi:Congratulations to the Metro strikers!
Mona Seif shares a similar thought:
@Monasosh: Those affected by the metro strike should go and find a way to get their demands met, so they can get back to work.
And Ola Shahba asks for more support for metro workers:
@OlaShahba: The metro strike is an example of workers who know how to hurt the government and force it to negotiate when they realize that the service they provide cannot be stopped for long.
We must support them so that they do not succumb to pressure
Dina Samak compares the success of the metro workers' strike to the lack of attention faced by the ongoing doctors' strike in Egypt.
@dinasamak: The metro strike was an immediate success because stopping transport hurts capitalism.
But the doctors' strike continues because the ruler still doesn't care about the poor.
The solution lies in solidarity among all.
Egyptian doctors have been on a partial strike since October 1.
And Nermeen Bedair adds:
@Nermbed: My Facebook medical friends (both for and against the strike) suggest that doctors ask metro workers to add the doctors' demands to their own.
While Mohamed Shawkuy comments:
@shawkination: Metro drivers went on strike that led to the country stopping completely.
After four hours, there are changes in the ministry.
Doctors have been on strike for 45 days and nobody pays attention because nobody died
"Bombs fall like rain on Gaza"
The inhabitants of Gaza stayed up all night while Israel continued to bomb the Palestinian enclave.

And Majed Abusalama adds:
@MajedAbusalama: Our morale is high in Gaza.
We will let them destroy everything and murder our children, but they will never kill our will or our dreams.
To the release by the will of God!

The Public Voice: Privacy rights are a global challenge
October 22, 2012 was an important day for global civil society defending privacy and freedom of expression.
The public voice coalition held a global conference in Punta del Este, Uruguay.
CC by The Public Voice
The live conversation was continued using the #tpv12 tag to ask questions, participate in surveys and chat in different languages with those covering the event.
The conference aimed to assess the culture and privacy perspectives across the world.
In addition, members of civil society discussed the spread of surveillance technologies and their involvement in society, while experts studied the political, legal and technological perspective of Hispanic America regarding privacy governance and suggested that governments and the private sector safeguard citizens' privacy.
The programme was read and broadcast live on the Internet in both English and Spanish.
Throughout the day, exhibitors assessed privacy culture and perspectives around the world.
They were aware of surveillance technologies and their implications for consumers on freedom of expression and human rights.
In addition, they studied the political, legal and technological perspectives of Hispanic America.
This is a small window that civil society has before the 34th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Authorities, which includes all government agencies in the world, the relay is available here.
This conference can present topics relevant to citizens at the round table.
Bolivia, do you have the Internet?
The 2012 National Population and Housing Census of Bolivia was conducted on November 21.
The previous census took place more than a decade ago, in December 2001.
Led by the National Statistics Institute (INE), the 2012 national census aims to provide updated information on demographic, social, economic and housing conditions in the country, allowing to adjust, define and evaluate plans, programs, public policies and strategies for human, economic and social development at national, departmental and municipal level.
The census questionnaire, which is primarily aimed at demographic and housing issues, has sparked debate on social media platforms over the question 17: Does this home have internet access?
However, the only question regarding internet access is only about the service, regardless of the type of connection, quality, use, digital divide and so on, missing the opportunity to gather more in-depth information on this matter.
Nayeli and Carla from Safe the Children (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)
It is estimated that about 30% of the population and 9% of households have access to the internet in Bolivia.
The number is not high; however, the quality shows an even worse scenario: only 0.7 out of 100 have broadband connection.
Mario Durán, a blogger and activist living in El Alto, argues in his blog that question 17 should be answered as no  if access to the internet is through a broadband mobile device or mobile phone.
After sharing their position on social media platforms, a series of responses came in favor and against their argument.
Eliana Quiroz, a well-known digital activist, commented in an open discussion on the campaign page of Facebook Master Bandwidth for Bolivia :
Adding more questions is expensive and they don't consider the Internet connection to be strategic because they didn't include anything.
The question is as it is and so only has to be answered.
For the next census I hope there will be a batch of questions about the Internet, lobbying and activism where appropriate.
Despite the gaps in the census questions, Grover Yapura (@GroverYapura) states through his Twitter account:
@GroverYapura: #Census2012, there is only one option on 21: Be counted and help count #Bolivia
The mainstream media and citizens actively reported on the National Census of Bolivia through the #Censo2012 and #CensoBo labels.
India: Dalit houses burned for caste marriages
On November 7 to 2000 people attacked three Dalits settlements in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, according to the International Dalit Solidarity Network (ISDN) based on sources from The Hindu, IBN, Times of India and Countercurrents.
According to the newspapers, a nursing student from the community of Vanniyar (shudrá) married a name from the community of Aadidravida (dalit) in the colony of Natham.
After her father committed suicide for dishonor, crowds organized against the Dalits.
According to ISDN, the crowds arrived in large numbers in the afternoon, looted Dalits' homes and set them on fire with molotov cocktails.
Hundreds of homes were damaged and 1,500 Dalits were left without shelter or belongings.
It remains open and ambiguous that the greatest violence against the Dalits in Timiladu has been inflicted by thevars and vanniyars, two of the largest shudrá communities led by different political parties".
According to IDSN, Henri Tiphagne, executive director of human rights organization Peoples Watch, (IDSN partner) traveled to the area to assess the situation and offer help to children and said: "It was the most shocking of the incidents of caste atrocities I have seen in my life so far regarding the effects of the incident - a caste marriage that had been carried out with the knowledge of the police and protection that ended in violence with the attack on 430 houses".

Colombia: Cali organizes its third Barcamp
Next Monday 17 December will be the third edition of Barcamp Cali, a free culture event organized in the city of Cali, Colombia, by DELM Cali and the Autonomous University of the West, and with the participation of some communities such as: Fosschix Colombia, Fundación Casa del Bosque, PrimeCom and Trueque Digital.
Here is an excerpt from the invitation made via the event's blog:
You may wonder what a Barcamp  is very simple, it is a space where knowledge is freely, openly and participatoryly shared, on topics related to ICT through voluntary talks called conferences  what there are is people willing to share what they know and also willing to listen to what you know.
The event has generated expectation among the Callean internet users, who have been tweeting about it, such as Luis RoDevia (@luisrodevia):
@NelsonAdrianF: Those who like to share software, art and cultural content can't miss #Barcampcali3 cc @barcampcalico
While Lina Maria (@LinaMaO) comments:
@LinaMaO: Hey, how cool is Professor Julio going to @barcampcalico http://barcampcali.co/2012/el-profe-julio-present-in-el-3er-barcamp-cali/ ... you can't imagine the math classes I've seen him do xD
She refers to the professor and engineer Julio Alberto Ríos Gallego, better known as the  Professor Julio  on YouTube, where he is very popular (almost a kind of star), and what is unusual, in a field so at first glance unattractive to users of that platform as is physics and mathematics.
The Barcamp Cali blog reports:
Barcamp Cali, 2nd edition (CC BY-SA 3.0)
As mentioned earlier, the free software community Fosschix Colombia will actively participate in the event, and one of its members, Liz García, will give a discourse about free software and gender empowerment.
About Fosschix they write in the Barcamp blog:
This community has been working for 3 years to motivate women to participate and get started in the world of free software whether in development, research or dissemination and be an active part of Free Culture.
Recently, the I National Congress of Women, Technology and Free Culture was successfully organized in Bogotá.
It should be noted that the first edition of Barcamp Cali was attended by about 100 people, while the second edition was attended by about 300.
This year attendance is expected to be equal to or greater.

Iran: Nasrin Sotoudeh, jailed lawyer, ends hunger strike after 49 days
Nasrin Sotoudeh, source: http://ahurai.com/social
The Iranian blogosphere has been filled with joy after lawyer and prisoner of conscience Nasrin Sotoudeh reported that she had concluded her 49-day hunger strike.
Multiple sources, including the Kaleme website affiliated with the Green Movement -of opposition- have cited Nasrin Sotoudeh's husband, Reza Khandan, who said that meetings with the Islamic Consultative Assembly (Parliament) and negotiations with the president of the Iranian Parliament and the head of the Judicial Power have resulted in the lifting of the travel ban imposed on her teenage daughter.
With her demand satisfied, Nasrin Sotoudeh ended her hunger strike.
A very proud and happy Iranian blogger, Azadi Esteghlal Edalat (meaning Freedom, Independence and Justice) writes:
Signed to death against cruelty and injustice, and by bringing the whole world together in their battle against the injustice the regime was doing to its beloved daughter (Mehraveh), our dear Narin Sotoudeh has ended her hunger strike now that legal restrictions against Mehrave have been lifted.
She taught the suffering Iranian people a lesson of hope and resilience.
Nasrin Sotoudeh is the lioness of Iran, the pride of every Iranian liberal.
Happy victory!

Legend says, "Your presence alone breaks the darkness".
Azadeghi exalted the courage of Nasrin Sotoudeh, and says:
It was the victory of the will of an Iranian woman against the Taliban regime.
Nasrin Sotoudeh should know that she was not alone, that many Iranians supported her.
Nasrin Sotoudeh talks about the execution of minors
In this short interview (subtitled in English) Nasrin criticizes the Islamic Republic's judicial system, and calls on the regime to stop the execution of prisoners under the age of 18.
Global Voices and the Power of Us
Have you ever wondered how we do what we do at Global Voices?
Here's a behind-the-scenes look at how the more than 700 members of our diverse, global, and fully virtual community bring together stories.
Every day, our department leaders, publishers, authors and volunteer translators work together across borders, time zones and language barriers to expand the best of citizen and social media, inform about free expression online and support others to join the global conversation.
To kick off the fundraising campaign for the end-of-year season, this analysis of how an article was made shows how the combined efforts of many people combine to make Global Voices so unique.
October 23, 2012: João Miguel, from his home in Fortaleza, Brazil, sends an email to the distribution list of his volunteer Portuguese teammates about an incident involving the Kaiowá Guarani, Brazil's second largest ethnic group, who are under threat of eviction from their ancestral lands in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul.
Janet, in the UK, writes a short post in English quickly, while six other group members in five different cities in Brazil, Portugal and Spain get their hands on the work and investigate the story.
October 24, 2012: Sara, editor of Global Voices in Portuguese, publishes the story in Portuguese with the collaboration of Diego, Elisa, João Miguel, Luís and Raphael.
October 25, 2012: Janet begins translating the article into English, with the support of our Multilingual Publisher Paula in London and João Miguel in Fortaleza for subtitling the inserted video.
The English version is sent to the sub-publisher mailing list, where Kevin takes it to Melbourne, Australia.
Kevin corrects the post, and it is posted on the Global Voices website in English.
In just a few hours, nine people on three continents, five countries and seven cities have collaborated to spread the story of the "Kaiowa Guaraní Resistance Cry" to the world in Portuguese and English.
October 26, 2012: Ines translates the post into French.
October 31, 2012: Cristina, Mario and Gabriela translate the post into Catalan, German and Spanish, respectively.
2 November 2012: Giulia translates it into Italian.
Right now, other Global Voices teams are doing exactly the same, across borders and time zones and languages, to expand important citizen-driven stories that conventional media have no time or interest in covering.
We're grateful for the funding we've received from the foundations that have supported us over the last few years, but to keep doing what we do, and to stay independent, free and sustainable, we also depend on the generous support of friends and independent readers like you.
At this year's end party, please consider giving a gift to Global Voices.

Voices of Dignity - Women survivors of the armed conflict in Colombia
Voices of Dignity, a multimedia project of the Centre for Transitional Justice (ICTJ), tells the story of Yoladis Zúñiga and Petronila Mendoza, two Colombian women who fled their homes after paramilitaries murdered their husbands and assaulted their villages.
The project, launched in late November 2012, includes three photo galleries and a 22-minute video that can be viewed completely online.
Marta Martínez, producer of Voices of Dignity, wrote a guest post on Witness joining the 16-day campaign of activism against gender-based violence, where she explained:
Yoladis Zúñiga and Petronila Mendoza survived a right-wing paramilitary attack in their villages; where they raped women and girls, burned houses and killed villagers, including their husbands.
The two women fled with their children to Baranquilla, a city on Colombia's Atlantic coast, joining the four million displaced by the civil war.
I'm not going to lie.

Marta also highlighted the message she intends to give Voices of Dignity:
While the Colombian government is launching new rounds of peace negotiations with leftist guerrillas or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), there has been much speculation about the possibility of a sustainable peace.
The ICTY's research and comparative experience show that sustainable peace cannot be achieved without ensuring justice, accountability and rights for victims.
In the words of María Camila Moreno, head of the ICTJ office in Colombia: The victims are not numbers.
They are people of flesh and blood, with dignity, who have a clear view of the steps Colombia must take to respond to its right to compensation .
I'm not going to tell you.
Photo by Camilo Aldana for ICTJ, used with his permission.
Through the powerful testimonies of Yoladis and Petronila, Voices of Dignity offers an intimate look at the lives of the victims of the armed conflict in Colombia.
An ICTJ article on Voices of Dignity adds:
In telling the story of Yoladis and Petronila, Voices of Dignity breaks with the stereotype that women victims of conflict are passive actors in a transitional society.
On the contrary, it shows them as active participants and leaders; of their families and communities, they are not victims, but heroes.
Marta stated that the goal of this multimedia project is "to reaffirm the fundamental rights of victims in Colombia and everywhere: the right to the truth, to be recognized and compensated".
Voices of Dignity is available in Spanish, and soon also in Arabic.
Meeting the Global Voices contributor - Janet Gunter
When a member of the Global Voices community travels to another country, he usually looks for ways to meet his GV colleagues on the sites he reaches.
A few days ago Janet Gunter was in Lima and we met to taste some typical pisco sours, but also to chat on various topics.
Janet Gunter, photo from http://pattamanuch.com used with permission.
How did you get involved in GV?
Through Sarita and our blogs about East Timor.
In fact, we met in person in East Timor.
Then I met Paula in London.
For me, GV has always been about meeting and working with great people.
So you started collaborating with GV in Portuguese as a translator, editor or both?
As an author, covering the Linguistic Africa. Then, when people started writing in Portuguese, I started translating the texts into English.
I usually translate articles by African authors.
Tell us about your role in the Global Voices special coverage of "Europe in Crisis".
Instigator/Encouragement!
I have lived in Portugal for three years and the events that take place there have personal value.
We have received a very good response from authors and translators as well as from the public.
In addition, the Greek, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and French editions all have very committed publishers.
We are currently between 60 and 70 editors and translators collaborating and communicating.
Do you think there's anything that could improve the coverage GV is making of Europe (in Crisis)?
We need RSS notifications and ideally we'd get a publisher, but we're looking for institutional financial support for that.
As a freelancer, you work with NGOs while working in other areas, how do you reconcile these sometimes different worlds?
With 30 columns on my Tweetdeck and giving up a "life of my own".
Now seriously, I've realized that my talents as an activist, especially those related to networking and communication, are very useful in my work life. In the "professional sphere", I get more and more favorable responses to my description of myself, which is very accurate as to what motivates me and the kind of person I am.
(This came about when I put my interests on paper.)
Two questions: What motivates you most, and what do you think are the challenges you have faced in the different jobs you have had?
Besides people, what motivates me is a combination of reaction to injustice, creativity, and a desire to see the world.
You say you're a bad tourist, but you've traveled a lot.
Tell us something about this.
I don't have a house or a car.
In fact, I have almost nothing.
I travel a lot for work, but I also like slow train travel and visiting my friends who live far away.
I have too many, I'd give to write a book!
Last winter I took the train from Los Angeles to New Orleans, leaving a family home in California, stopping on the plains of western Texas for a couple of days, and ending up visiting friends in New Orleans.
Then I went to see my 94-year-old grandfather, born in New Orleans, and drove two days back to my birthplace, St. Louis.
Louis, with my father, dodging tornado alerts and listening to country music on modulated amplitude (AM) radio.
That's the kind of travel I love.
Apart from all the things she's told us, Janet gives herself time to have a personal project, the restart project.
That's what the following article tells us:
And well, you can find Janet here and also on Twitter of course.
Saudi Arabia: Public hunger strike in support of imprisoned activist
Saudi human rights activist Mohammad al-Bajady has attracted a lot of attention on Twitter over the past few weeks.
Al-Bajady is one of the co-founders of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) and has been detained since March 21, 2011, after taking part in a protest calling for an end to arbitrary detention outside the Ministry of Interior building in Riyadh.
He was tried in secret and sentenced last April to four years in prison.
On 14 November, ACPRA issued the following statement:
In the last call from human rights activist Mohammad al-Bajady, which was on September 19, 2012, he told his wife that he would start a hunger strike after the call to protest against the abuse.
Our sources tell us he was held in solitary confinement.
Since he announced the hunger strike, no calls have been received.
On December 9, @freealbjadi announced a public hunger strike to support al-Bajady on December 10, International Human Rights Day:
@freealbjadi: Suffer what al-Bajady faces in prison and announce his hunger strike tomorrow...
Logo of the campaign "Save al-Bajady".
Dozens of reformist figures announced that they would be part of the public hunger strike announced on the #سأشارك_غدا_بالإضراب_عن_الطعام_تضامنا_مع_إضراب_البجادي tag, including activist Mohammad al-Qahtani, former political prisoner Matrook al-Faleh and famous blogger Fouad al-Farhan along with 200 others, while the public hunger strike in support of al-Bajady, which took place last March, had only 38 participants.
By strictly banning demonstrations, Saudi Arabia calls for new methods of public dissent, mostly by young people.
Egypt: Graffiti on the walls of the presidential palace
It seems that the revolutionary spirit has been boosted in Egypt, thanks to the seizure of power by President Mohamed Morsi - his recent resolution giving him broad decision-making power.
The decision sparked protests across the country and mainly a parade around the presidential palace was organized.
Photographer Jonathan Rashad, who has been actively using his camera to document important events since the beginning of the Egyptian revolution, shares the following graffiti photographs that tell the story on his Flickr account.
Here is a selection:

Another young woman raped and murdered in Bangladesh
The victim, Khomaching Marma, was only 14 years old and an eighth-grade student.
She was last seen near the jungle while she was taking her family's cattle home.
Rina Dewan posted the following comment on her Facebook wall about the motives behind such atrocity:
There is a settler village called Nallyachari Uttor Matha half a kilometer away from where Thomaching's body was found.
In the early 1980s, the government expelled the Marmas from their territory and housed the Bengalis there.
Now, these settlers claim a large part of Borodalupara.
Violence against indigenous women has increased recently.
Image from A M Ahad.
The following is the list of the official languages of the European Union:
Recently, violence against indigenous women has increased.
A few months ago, another indigenous girl was raped; she was a fifth-grade student.
Journalist Hari Kishore Chakma provides some statistics on the rape of indigenous women in a recent article in the newspaper Prothom Alo:
As of last November, 20 indigenous women have been murdered in three mountain districts.
Now, to this list that is only growing, the name of Thomaching Marma is added. According to data from human rights organization Kapaeng, during 2012, 51 women were raped; in 2011 there were 31 victims and, in 2008, four".
This brutal rape and murder case has once again spread anger across the country and marches have been organized in the Dhaka, Chittagong and Sylhet regions.
In addition, the internet users have also expressed their anger through protests.

Are we as insensitive as our sister's cold corpse?
India has vehemently protested the recent gang rape, Imphal has called for justice for the sexual harassment of a girl.
Adivasi Aodhikar Andolon (CHT) writes:
I see in the news how India is clamoring for the demonstrations against gang rape on a Delhi bus. It's fantastic to witness their union.
The Indian government has been forced to arrest those responsible.
Recently, an Indian girl has been raped and murdered in Borodalupara village, Kawkhali Upala, Rangamati district.
The police have not arrested a single person responsible!
In this way, hundreds of our indigenous sisters and mothers have long been victims of rape and murder.
Blogger Anik says:
These crimes create an image in my mind about Bangladesh: the image of rapists and murderers.
It seems we're constantly surrounded by atrocious rapists and potential killers.
Don't mess with Egyptian women!
Maryanne Gabbani, a Canadian blogger, wrote a new post titled "Don't mess with Egyptian women" to mention two stories she heard that happened recently in the village where she lives.
He begins his story by pointing out his observation about women in his village:
The women of my area have my deep and enduring respect.
They care about farms, families and homes in rather harsh conditions, and never stop having a smile, a greeting and reaching out to others.
They're the steel of their families.
Although this is a very traditional part of the country and of strong religious conviction, these women are also very tolerant and friendly and have always been a source of laughter and joy for me, an unconventional Canadian who grows older.
Then he tells the first story he heard from many of his neighbors, who disagree with the Muslim Brotherhood government, this way:
A neighbor told me how, when buses came to move protesters to Heliopolis for the demonstration at the presidential palace that turned so bloody a few weeks ago, some of the mothers around me informed their children that if anyone wanted to take the bus to the city, it was okay for them to do so, but they wouldn't bother to come back.
The following story is about a new small religious group of eight people who decided to help the locals behave more "appropriately".
So apparently, a group of Takfir wal Higra (Excommunication and Hegira) moved to our area to help our local population behave more "appropriately".
They were seen walking along the roads in their short galabeyas (traditional clothes) and had taken a mosque to pray and an office in Abu Sir to organize.
About a week ago, eight of the men went to Abu Sir's main souq and when they walked in, they saw a woman sitting near their products, and a little bit of her leg was noticeable outside the galabeya.
Very rude, kicking his leg, told him to cover himself and be decent.
This was a monumental mistake.
It turns out this woman was the head of the souq and a member of a very popular group in the area that reaches thousands.
She and the other women at the market attacked the eight men and beat them so hard they had to go to the hospital.
When the men tried to file a police report on the attack, the police refused to take the report and told them they weren't going to go against these women... were they crazy?
So now the young people of Abu Sir are using the offincine as a tea room and the mosque is no longer used for their fundamentalist sermons and no one has seen the Takfir group for some time.
He concludes his post by confirming:
If anyone asks who to support to get rid of the Islamists in Egypt, there is the answer.
The women of Egypt are some of the strongest women I've ever seen.
Bolivia: Potential illegal patent for QR code discovered
Bolivian cyber activists have worked collectively to uncover a potential illegal patent on the use of Quick Response Codes, or QR codes, in the country.
In early December, Bolivian networker @hermany aroused curiosity about the matter by inquiring on Twitter about the allegedly patented use of QR codes in Bolivia:
@hermany: Can someone at Peace tell me if Advice Marketing Ltda. patented QRs and have to pay them for their use? #Boliva #Tech #fraude?
Photo by Lydia Shiningbrightly (CC BY 2.0)
The company's website has removed the patent announcement from its website but activist Daniel Cotillas (@danicotillas) took and shared a screenshot.
Continuing the collective investigations under the #QRBolivia label, blogger Mario Durán of El Alto contacted the National Intellectual Property Service (SENAPI) and representatives of the company.
Mario has been posting updates on the case regularly on his blog under the question "Can the use of QR codes be patented in Bolivia?".
According to the information collected by Mario, Advice Marketing officially declares (pdf) that QR codes can be used publicly simply by prior notification.
Meanwhile, SENAPI executives have confirmed that the company applied for the patent in September 2012; however, SENAPI has not issued a resolution on this (the legal period for a decision is 18 months).
Therefore, such a patent or restriction may not apply.
Of course, Bolivian cyber activists will be closely monitoring the matter as the case unfolds over the coming months.
You can follow your debate under the #QRBolivia tag.
Egyptians demand free and open source software
Much has been said about the liberalising role technology played during the Arab Spring, but much remains to be said about the future reciprocal role the revolution will play in liberalising technology.
Last Wednesday, the Egyptian prime minister posted on his official Facebook page the summary of one of his meetings.
In this, the government agreed to invest $43.8 million to acquire licenses and software from Microsoft.
Many Egyptian citizens have begun to express their discontent.
@rrcoalition: The government pays $44 million for Microsoft software and, at the same time, claims it is about to file for bankruptcy.
@Aya_Ayman: Yes, because the government feeds and shelters the poor and homeless in Egypt and they still have a few million left!
However, people are not angry about the huge sum of money that is going to be spent, but they are mostly angry because there are better alternatives that would cost less and that would help grow the local software development community.
Samar Ali (@SaMoRaAli) shared this banner on Twitter.
@Gue3bara: Instead of spending all this money, the government could have invested just a million in software developers to create an alternative solution and be able to use open source software.
Omar Ak briefly explains the principles of open source software:
@i3mmoor: In addition to being free, the open source software can be modified and no updates are paid for. #OpenEgypt.
Nagla Rizk, founding director of A2K4D (the knowledge access center for development at the American University in Cairo) and a member of the executive committee of the Open A.I.R. project (research for open innovation in Africa), commented on Twitter:
@naglarzk: This contract with Microsoft not only increases its presence in the Egyptian market but also reduces the chances of local small businesses competing in the market, especially those that rely on open source software.
@naglarzk: The $43 million deal with Microsoft is a significant setback for #Egypt, especially after a revolution that promised transparency, collaboration and freedom. #OpenEgypt
Hossam El-Hamalawy (@3arabawy) published a detailed list of reasons why this contract should not be signed.
In addition, many other organizations and users have begun to sign this petition.
But it doesn't end here: members of the Egyptian open source software community protested in a silent demonstration in front of the cabinet on December 30.
Moreover, protests are being organized across the country and the #OpenEgypt tag is serving to introduce people to open source software and make its benefits known.
They kill trees in Egypt
Michael Hanna, an Egyptian blogger and pharmacist, continued his series of mourning not only for the killing of trees but also for the demolition of ancient villas in the Heliopolis suburb of Cairo, and wrote an ode to a palm tree.
Three months ago, he took a photograph of what may be the oldest palm tree in the region.
He blogs: Maybe this palm tree was the tallest and oldest in the Heliopolis area, and maybe it's as old as the suburb itself.

Yesterday, I was passing by the place, and I was surprised that someone decided to end the palm tree's life... leaving only this.
Remnants of logs and just a well where people throw trash.

Graffiti in Tehran
Iran is not a country known for its freedom of expression or public expression; however, urban art is alive there.
Frescoes, mosaics and other 'permitted' forms of art decorate the walls of some cities; and, although underground art is not as prominent as in Europe, it is possible to see it in Tehran: graffiti, stickers and templates are present in a more or less discreet manner in cities.
Some walls are completely covered with propaganda paintings (of a martyr, for example), but also abstract or merely ornamental images.
And some are real works of art.
A few weeks ago, a photographer from Tehran sent an email with these graffiti images and the following comment:
I took these pictures in Tehran, near a bus stop.
I think someone is fighting with the Tehran municipalities: one day someone makes a graffiti and the next day they erase it.
And so day after day.
Graffiti in Tehran.
This is the first time I've seen this.

Three weeks later, when I asked her permission to quote her and post these photos, she said it would be an honor and wanted to add:
Now they've put something like a drawing or a sign on that wall to keep anyone from adding more graffiti.
Before, that same wall was filled with filth; now, at least, it's not disgusting.
So the enemy of the municipality is now a friend of the people because the wall is no longer dirty.
Those who express themselves in Iran are at greater risk than in Europe. Currently, there are no laws in Iran, but if the authorities consider the work subversive, art can become a crime.
Urban art is flourishing in Iran.
Yesterday I defected from Assad's army
As part of our collaboration with Syria Deeply, we're publishing a series of articles that capture the voices of civilians caught in the crossfire, along with perspectives on the conflict from writers around the world.
Next up is a conversation between News Deeply and a 20-year-old man who defected from the Syrian Army's Sulas Military Base and joined the rebel side.
At your request, we will not use your name in this article.
We are in a house used by the Free Syrian Army deep in the mountains of Jebel Turkman, in Latakia province.
As the bombs rocked the windows, he shone a light on the complicated mentality shared by many of Bashar al-Assad's soldiers: men forced to serve mandatory terms in the army, desperately wanting to join the opposition.
"It's the first time I've seen a journalist or an American", he says timidly.
He says a shabiha escort was assigned to each new soldier, to make sure he didn't defect.
This came after a recent streak of desertions that apparently shook the confidence of the army.
"The soldiers were scared of the Free Syrian Army.
Many of them would like to desert, but the shabiha, staying with us, are watching us as security so we're not leaving".

The young soldiers barely talked about the matter among themselves.
I was just talking about this with my family.
I couldn't talk to anyone else about it, even though we all wanted to go.
I would never do it... shoot into the air, give anything but fighters.
A lot of people do that. Those who look don't notice.
The officers have power and say, 'We'll succeed, we'll go home.'
But the fighters know it's coming.
He served most of his time in the army in Idlib, and was prominent in the Latakia mountains for the past two months.
At that moment he says, "I never had a vacation.
Before coming to our interview, I was worried about my safety by talking to him. How could the leader of the Free Syrian Army battalion who introduced us guarantee that his new fighter was not really a double agent who would report us to the regime?
"I spoke to your father in Damascus", the leader told me.
Trying to give me confidence, he said that given the security of the regime's bases, and based on physical ground, only the most loyal men manage to escape.
Tradition of the Three Magi in New York
This historical and religious background is complex (like Christianity itself), and it has been part of the Caribbean and Latin American cultural traditions for several centuries.
In Puerto Rico, for example, during King's Eve, children leave grass in a shoebox for Melchor, Gaspar, and Baltasar's horses in gratitude for the gifts they receive the next day.
Below we share a series of photographs taken by Puerto Rican artist Josué Guarionex, showing some of the faces he managed to capture in the middle of that whole movement.
Jesus "Papoleto" Melendez, poet born and raised in El Barrio, was elected as king emeritus of the parade.

Osvaldo Gómez delighted us with his beautiful presence.
We can almost feel the energy of this band in this photo.
Hundreds of girls and boys marched with their paper crowns from 106th Street to 116th Street and Park Avenue.
The prominent reporter Maria Hinojosa, as well as activist Angie Rivera, were chosen as the queen mages for this occasion.
Fatima Shama, commissioner of the New York City Office of Immigrant Affairs, was chosen as one of the mages.
Tanya Torres, Puerto Rican artist based in El Barrio, was one of the godmothers of the stop alongside Nadema Agard, Cecilia Gastón, Christine Licata and Sandra Morales-De León.
Walking the streets of New York City with so many children is a tremendous gift.
Cuba launches expected immigration reform
On 14 January 2013, a historic immigration reform came into force in Cuba, which should facilitate entry and exit from the country.
According to the Havana Times, Cubans can now apply for a passport to travel outside the country for a maximum of 24 months, without having to apply for a special government permit.
The new regulation eliminates the previously required 'permit to leave' and 'invitation letter' and relaxes the rules for healthcare and sports professionals and those who have migrated illegally.
In August 2012, the author of "Eve's Other Eyes" referred to "internationalist missions", governmental projects to help other countries mainly in sectors such as education and health that also represent economic relief for Cuban professionals.
In another article (of fiction), the author narrates the departure of a father through the port of Mariel:
My father jumped into the sea, pushed himself over the waves and got lost in the horizon, leaving us an empty seat at the table and hopes of filling the caskets again very soon. My father left one afternoon, some time ago, maybe a little longer and we still haven't figured out exactly where in the Caribbean to throw flowers.
From 14 January 2013, Cuban citizens will be able to apply for passports at the offices of the Carné de Identidad and Registro de Población as well as the Immigration and Extranjería to travel outside the country without having to ask the government for permission.

According to a report by the Havana Times, which quotes the Immigration and External Affairs Directorate, a total of 195 sites have been enabled for this purpose.
According to the digital magazine, "it is estimated that the historic reform will benefit a large number of Cubans who, provided they can finance the trip and obtain the visa from the destination country, will be able to travel more easily abroad".
However, "it will not involve a mass exit from the island.
Regarding travel to the United States, an article published by the digital site Café Fuerte notes:
Cuba will allow its citizens to travel as emigrants and even welcome the Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA) in the United States without losing their rights as residents of the island within two years, a senior government official announced.
But some citizens, including high-performing athletes, will still have to apply for permission to leave the country.
In addition, the law includes an incision that has been questioned by several bloggers.
Fernando Ravsberg, author of Letters from Cuba, points out:
However, the H-clause states that they may not travel 'when, for other reasons of public interest, the competent authorities so determine'.
Such vagueness gives the officials absolute power over the citizen.
The shortage of teachers could be considered a reason of public interest and the Ministry of Education can feel empowered to prevent an educator from travelling.
Dozens of foreign media outlets have echoed the news and some users from other nations celebrate Cuba's immigration reform, although they note:
Cuban state television broadcast a television program with more details on immigration reform.

Patagonia Argentina, a place frequented by travel bloggers and tourists
For this summer holiday of 2013, Argentines have chosen the Argentine Patagonia as a destination.
According to the newspaper Perfil, in its tourism sector, one of the reasons has been the prices and the wide variety it offers in terms of tourist spots.
But also, Patagonia is a destination for those who want to ride a bicycle, as is the case with the bloggers of La Vida de Viaje, who tell their entire journey, adventures and misadventures through their blog:
After a few hours of pedaling to Tolhuin, we stopped for two days at the home of the Ullua family who contacted us via Facebook to get to know us and to have a place to stop when we arrived.
We found that this town places a special value on cycling.
Other Argentine bloggers, like Juan and Laura de Acróbatas del Camino, decide to travel with their fingers, who have not only traveled through Patagonia, but are currently traveling around the world.
In one of their posts, they recount their experiences living in Puerto Madryn and their concern for the Environment.
Even before I saw the first whale, I couldn't get two thoughts out of my mind.
The human being walks like a voyeur celebrating species whose corners he subscribes to with the rest of his social habits.
There are uncomfortable truths, but charging the car's tank is fostering global warming that decreases the concentration of the krill that the whales feed on.
And the post goes on
Of course, all tourists arrive by car, and many would agree to have one for each family member if possible.
Because of course, you have to take the kids to school.
To teach them that we must take care of the environment for example... even we fall partly into that contradiction, when we travel with our fingers and use cars, although I take comfort in thinking that we only occupy an empty place in a car that is already in motion.
Photo taken by the author of the post.
We always like to have a lot of kids at the shows, but in the case of hospitals it's very different: the less the better.
The kids shouldn't be there, they should be playing in a square, which is why we always say goodbye to hospitals with the same phrase: "We wish them all the best to leave here as soon as possible". And every time we say that, parents close their eyes and nod their heads.
I wish it was.
Creating spoken dictionaries for indigenous languages
As part of the workshop "Enduring Voices", between 7 and 11 January 2013, twelve Latin American indigenous language activists met at the Library of Santiago, Chile, to explore how digital technologies can play a key role in documenting and revitalizing their native languages.
Organized and sponsored by the Enduring Voices Project, a collaboration between the Living Tongues Institute and the National Geographic Society, the workshop provided practical training on the use of digital tools at work.
Rising Voices also participated and gave a workshop on the use of citizen media to promote the use of indigenous languages online.
The main activity of the workshop was the creation of Talking Dictionaries.
This platform provides a multilingual online dictionary containing digital audio clips recorded by language activists currently working with the Living Tongues Institute.
Each participant received a technology kit based on their current needs.
Some of the activists received laptops, digital audio recorders and digital video cameras, tripods, headphones with the ability to cancel or decrease ambient sound and external hard drives to use in their work.
Participants examining the received technology kit.
However, the digital audio recorder was the one that played the most important role in the creation of the Spoken Word.
Each participant was able to record high-quality audio clips which were later edited into free programs such as Audacity.
The clips are tagged and uploaded to the server, hosted by Swarthmore University, where in the database they are placed in parallel and display the word in the indigenous language, English and Spanish.
Here we see Espiritu Bautista and his son Elmo recording audio clips of words in Yanesha, their native language, which is spoken in the central Amazon region of Peru.
At the end of the workshop there were nine new dictionaries spoken in languages such as Mapudungún, Tsesungun, Quechua Chanca, Yanesha, Miahuatec Zapoteco, Mazahua, Mam, Pipil, Besiro and the expansion of an existing dictionary in Ishír (Chamacoco).
Each participant returned to their local community equipped with the tools and knowledge to continue adding more words to the spoken dictionaries with a clear mandate to explore the best path for use in the communities.
Colombia: A long road to peace?
This post is part of our special coverage of International Relations and Security.

In the early hours of New Year's Day, the Colombian Armed Forces launched an airstrike against a Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) camp near Chigorodó in northwestern Colombia.
The airstrike came after Elda Ramirez (aka 'Mayerly'), considered an important member of the FARC hierarchy, called a man she believed was a drug trafficker interested in buying cocaine.
To support the peace negotiations, the FARC announced a ceasefire on 20 November.
However, the Colombian armed forces have continued military operations against the organization.
On 20 January, the FARC announced that they had suspended the ceasefire and instead proposed a bilateral truce.
The Colombian government's attack and the broken ceasefire prompted a variety of responses from Colombian bloggers.
For example, a blogger in Colombia Opina celebrated the bombings and explains why the FARC's fifth front was so dangerous (links inserted by GV):
The FARC's 5th Front was a sort of terrorist training school.
From Efraín Guzmán to Ivan Márquez, and from today's demobilised Karina  to the still-armed alias Manteco , they have passed through the 5th front of the Farc, an old and bellicose guerrilla structure that in the early morning of December 31 received another blow from the Colombian Air Force in the Operation Fortuna : a bombing that left at least 14 bandit dead and returns the hope of security necessary to the inhabitants of a strategic area such as the Axe Bananero, which also borders the corridor that runs from the Serrania of Abibe and crosses the route of the Río Sucio to the Middle Atrato.
In contrast, Camilo Raigozo criticizes President Santos' "happiness" with the guerrilla killing:
The regime led by President Santos has refused to stop the blood and death orgy that binds the Colombian people, by not accepting a bilateral truce of fire, not even for Christmas and New Year.
The insatiable bloodlust of those in power prevents it.
Horacio Duque, in Third Information, asks if the unilateral ceasefire of the FARC has worked (link inserted by GV):
It seems, from the data provided by experts who follow the fighting in detail, that in the first 30 days the success has been resounding.
Fernando Dorado writes about the need to extend the ceasefire:
If the ceasefire period is maintained or extended beyond the Christmas and holiday season, the FARC guerrillas would be putting all the pressure on the government to agree a bilateral ceasefire, which would give more impetus to the peace process.
It seems that the Colombian government's reluctance to respect the FARC ceasefire is intended to weaken the group both militarily and strategically.
The effectiveness of this strategy will likely be determined throughout 2013, especially as the deadline (in November) for a peace agreement approaches.

Colombia: Bullets are still ringing in Medellin
A difficult public order situation exists in the city of Medellin.
The most named area is Comuna 13, where several clashes took place overnight over the past weekend.
The situation was so severe that the Metrocable transport system had to suspend operations for fifteen minutes, and there were two wounded by lost bullets that hit one of its cabins.

Two Twitter users, Juan Mosquera (@lluevelove) and rapper Jeihhco (@Jeihhco) expressed their grief and called for reflection.
Global Voices brings together their voices by listing some of their tweets about it:
I 'm not going to lie .
@lluevelove: Bullets at night, silence at dawn, gunpowder at noon, fear in the afternoon.
@lluevelove: The whole city as one.
The whole town is a commune.
You and I have intact skin but we're both hurt, like the one you don't know.
I 'm not going to lie .
@Jehhico: Bullets are heard, again and unknowingly until Comuna 13, Medellin burns.
@Jehhico: Bullets are camouflaged between the gunpowder, between the life is feeling death close, sounds that hurt in the heart, in the soul.
@Jehhico: It hurts so much shit in the streets, the silence that the neighborhood has at this hour is a painful silence, it's terrifying, it's pure, latent fear.
In parallel to the events, a tag called #Medelllinnotienealcalde emerged, through which internet users proposed a conversation around the problems of the city, which has been characterized by its strength, but also by a history of violence, and which is now nominated for an award as the most innovative city in the world:

Mexico: Explosion at Pemex headquarters causes shock and speculation
At least 14 people have been killed and 80 injured so far as a result of a strong explosion that on Thursday, January 31, 2013, shook the headquarters of the state-owned company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex) in Mexico City as reported by the company's official Twitter account:
@pemex: Unfortunately, 14 people are confirmed dead and 80 injured at the moment
Some internet users, besides regretting the events, speculated about the real cause of the explosion.
As Think Mexican (@ThinkMexican), who noted through his Twitter account:
@ThinkMexican: The explosion in the #Pemex Tower comes days after @EPN responded to speculation that its administrator was seeking to privatize Mexico's oil.http://ow.ly/1RJUGC
Or the journalist and writer Raúl Tortolero (@raultortolero1), who asks himself:
@raultortolero1: Will we know transparently what happened at #Pemex today, or just version-by-modes?
While others like Ana (@AnaLargaespada) spoke about possible negligence:
@AnaLargaespada: #Pemex installations had already had 2 explosionshttp://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notes/899965.html ... (see video).
That smells like mismanagement.
And some others think it was the responsibility of the cartels, as Jorge (@TwytterMx) puts it:
@alexoescalona: I think it's very good not to speculate that Pemex was attacked, but it's also not to assume it was an accident. #PEMEX
On the other hand, there were unspoken comments that many reacted to, such as filmmaker and columnist Mariano Bouchot (@marianobouchot), who disapproved of the jokes about the subject:
@marianobouchot: I don't understand or justify the jokes that are made about the tragedy.
What happened today at #Pemex is not a joke.
There were also many websites that spread useful information.
For example, Fherb (@LFernando24) tweeted:
@LFernandoo24: Help please: Blood donors are needed at Pemex Central North Azcapotzalco hospital... #Pemex
And Maru Iniestra (@889Maru) shares a link to the report of wounded:
While a large number of webmasters are already offering condolences to the families of those who lost their lives, such as economist and blogger Guillermo Barba (@memobarba):
Pemex's website already shows a black ribbon in mourning.

Egypt is silent about the Sinai floods
Sinai is being debated by floods after heavy rainfall in the region.
There is very little information available in the online media, amid a complete silence in the traditional media.
On Twitter, Ibrahim Elgarhi is tweeting to Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi, saying:
@Ibrahim_Elgarhi: Urgent and humanitarian: There are numerous families besieged in Sinai, in Firan Valley, who have been isolated by the floods and need urgent help.
Please note that Sinai is part of Egypt, dear President
Faced with the absence of help from the authorities, Alyaa Gad is gathering support for the action among the internet users:
@AlyaaGad: How do we help the 1,400 families surrounded by floods in Sinai? (Forget about government because there is no government).
What can we do?
@waelabbas: There are 1,400 families isolated in southern Sinai in Firan Valley due to flooding.
They're without food and electricity and no media, no politicians, no one is talking about them.
They sent me an SOS.

The maritime border dispute between Bolivia, Chile and Peru
This post is part of our special coverage of International Relations and Security.
Map of maritime claims from Ecuador, Peru, and neighboring countries.
From Political Geography Now through Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0)
International borders are often erased by globalization processes, but in South America some maritime borders remain contested.
For example, Chile and Peru, neighbors who have enjoyed sustained economic development in recent years, still disagree about some 38,000 square kilometers of sea along their maritime border.
Bilateral negotiations between the two countries were first held in 1980, but no agreement was reached.
In 2008, Peru took the case to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which, in turn, considered the issue in a public hearing in December 2012.
Meanwhile, Peru continues to argue that the maritime border has not yet been defined by any agreement, with documents signed in the 1950s only on access to fishing zones.
Lima also states that the maritime boundaries should run diagonally southwest from the land border.
Chile, for its part, maintains that maritime boundaries were agreed upon after the signing of the treaties of 1952 and 1954.
These imply that the maritime border should run parallel to the line of Ecuador, an agreement that Santiago claims Peru has respected for the past 60 years.
Supporting the Chilean position, weblogger Juan Vargas commented in Peru this Week:
The agreements of 1952 and 1954 clearly indicate and establish a maritime border.
They can be found in English at: http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/58820.pdf
Oscar Maúrtua de Romaña, a former Peruvian foreign minister, describes the arguments of both sides in a blog post by El Mirador, and concludes:
Peru and Chile, despite historical differences, share a common destiny.
A fair ruling by the court will put an end to the only border issue that casts a shadow on our bilateral relations.
It is reassuring that President Humala and President Piñera, 72 hours before the oral hearing began, have made a joint statement, in which they both pledged to comply with and implement the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
The Bolivian coast awaits the decision
The dispute between Chile and Peru also has direct implications in other states in the region.
In particular, Bolivia is closely following legal procedures, and has previously stated that it plans to make a case before the International Court of Justice to facilitate Chile's access to the Pacific coast it lost during the 1879-1881 war between the two countries.
The final outcome in the ICJ case can add a new impetus to Bolivia's attempts to seek a diplomatic solution to this longstanding problem.
Regardless of the ICJ's resolution, democratic and diplomatic statements made by all parties have significantly reduced the risk of armed conflict between the parties.
This, in turn, has laid the foundation for the development of more creative solutions to end the crisis.
These include "a maritime zone of Bilateral Participation" proposed by Jilmar Moisés Córdova, who argues:
The maritime dispute between Peru and Chile can be resolved by establishing a Bilateral Sea Participation Zone which would divide the seas of both States and would be devoted to fishing, i.e. the exploitation of living resources by vessels of up to a certain tonnage of Peruvian and Chilean peoples.
For example, Argentina and Uruguay maintain a treaty similar to this one that delimits their sovereign seas.
Cordoba also considers that this alternative could give both countries the opportunity to explore and benefit from minerals, oil and other resources.
He also believes that the bilateral Maritime Zone could offer alternative options for the aspirations of a coastline for Bolivia.

The search for a missing child unites Malaysia
William Yau is a six-year-old Malaysian boy who was left in the car with his siblings while his parents were going to a home appliance store on January 16.
Reportedly, his sister Cindy started crying, which caused him to get out of the car to go get his parents.
He never came back.
On Thursday, January 24, the child's body was found in a river.
According to DNA results released Monday, January 28, police confirmed that it is indeed William's body.
William's search was driven by the media using the National Emergency Response Alert (known as NUR by its English name) and quickly spread on the internet.
Malaysians posted posters and images on their blogs to help locate him.
From ordinary people like Eliza Teh to expert journalists like Nuraina Samad and Ahirudin Attan used their blogs to draw attention to William's case.
He's still lost.
Have you seen William?
If you have any information, please call 03-56319800 and 012-2197133.
William Yau's posters were posted on various social media sites.
So far there's been an outpouring of grief for William's family on social media.
Joel told how he too was separated from his parents when he was a child.
I still remember the incident well: a five-year-old boy in his pajamas, wandering through the old City Mall in Kuala Lumpur.
My parents were shopping in Metrojaya, and I was restless.
I walked to the nearest Toys R'Us toy store without my parents knowing, and soon, I got lost.
The fact that I'm writing about it is proof enough that nothing unpleasant happened to me.
You can't say the same about little William Yau.
The case of William Yau, who has dominated headlines and various social media sites, has come to the worst possible conclusion.
Little William's decomposed body was found floating in a river in Klang, a week after news of his disappearance launched a massive search.
I had a deep feeling of grief that drowned me, I felt the pain of little William's family, the pain of losing someone dear.
Web browsers helped spread the word about the search for the missing child.
Tumblr photo from Made by Malaysians.
Norliza Sani expressed her solidarity with William's parents:
The worst nightmare of a father is losing a child.
As parents, we often keep in mind that we are the ones who must leave first.
I think we all know that death comes to everyone, regardless of age, but no one is prepared when the situation finally happens.
My heart goes out to William Yau's parents.
May your son rest in peace.
I also have a six-year-old son, I hope you catch anyone who did this to yours and gets a severe punishment, Malaysia has a high number of missing children and doesn't catch any kidnappers.
This is something you should take into account.
It is truly disturbing and saddening to think that these criminals can remain free.
Many Malaysians, including celebrities and politicians, turned to Twitter to express their condolences.
@SheilaMajid: We are deeply saddened and we share the sadness over the passing of William Yau.
May God give his family strength to deal with this and rest him in peace.
@WardinaSafiyyah: To the parents of William Yau, I'm so sorry.
William Yau Zhen Zhong has been missing since January 16th:  Police have removed the body of a seven-year-old boy from Sungai Sireh.
@joannabessey: My condolences to William Yau and family.
As people in Malaysia and around the world, we must end this heinous deal with the trafficking of children and adults.
@drchuaSL: Our deepest condolences to the family of William Yau and hope they arrest the kidnapper/murderer as soon as possible.
Ecuador: Attack at political rally
On Monday night, February 4, 2013, in Quinindé, Esmeraldas province, a man stabbed several people at a rally by President Rafael Correa, killing two citizens and wounding four others.
Through its Twitter account, the Ministry of Interior (@MinInteriorEC) published the news:
@MinInteriorEC: Attention.
A regrettable incident in Quininde during Rafael Correa's tour.
In the same account, @MinInteriorEC, important data about the tragedy were published:
@MinInteriorEC: ATTENTION. @PoliciaEcuador has arrested the suspect in stabbing Rafael Correa supporters in Quinindé.

Foolishly stabbed seven AP people while they waited for the President.
Two dead.
We are back in Emeralds!
National media such as El Comercio, El Telégrafo and El Universo published the news; in La República and La Hora you can find a fan video of the attack on the people who were at the political rally.
RT News also echoed the news.
Rafael Correa (@MashiRafael) expressed his solidarity with the families of the deceased:
@Miguicho34: It's a shame to see or read so many people taking advantage of what happened in Quíninde that's not politics, have a little respect for the victims
Arturo Barriga (@arturobarriga) criticizes the political manipulation of the tragedy:
@arturobarriga: I can't believe there are people so ruinous that take advantage of the tragic event in Quininde to promote one candidacy or blame another
Shirley Borja (@ShirleyBorja7) calls for awareness of the violence in the country:
@ShirleyBorja7: Faced with the violence in Quinindé we must not let ourselves be carried away by those who provoke or incite verbal or physical violence.
Ecuadorians are concerned about civil security and hope that justice will be served after this unfortunate event.
Iran sent one monkey into space and another came back

Bloggers and information sources have questioned claims by the Iranian government that it successfully launched a monkey into space and recovered the animal alive on January 28, 2013.
Official images  allegedly depicting the monkey before and after the launch  do not appear to match, casting further doubt and generating suspicions that the launch could have been a mount.
These are official images recorded from a program of the state channel IRIB 1:
Many users on the popular Iranian link sharing website, Balatarin, say the regime is lying and compare photos of the monkey from before launch with a photo they claimed to have recovered from the capsule upon his return, highlighting physical differences between the two.
Here they are:
As seen in the main photo of this post, as well as the one above (right) the first monkey has a molar on its right eyebrow and has grey and shorter hair around its face, while the second monkey has no molar and has hair around its dark brown face.
The reactions of the internet users to this report range from total skepticism to conspiracy theories:
The Iranian blogger 'Hagh mosalam ma' ('Our Final Right') takes a satirical approach, drawing parallels between the alleged space mission and the 2009 Iranian presidential election that many consider to have been rigged.
He also jokes:
The monkey that was thrown into space was a friend, the one that came back was acting strangely.
With Photoshop you can send monkeys to Mars, not to mention out of the atmosphere.
Amir Farshad writes on his blog 'Hot Chocolate' that:
Mahmood Ahmadinejad gave the nation another good news this week for the arrival of the Fajr festivals: "We have launched a monkey into space and managed to perform an aesthetic surgery to remove his moles up there and then we brought him back in good health to the Supreme Leader's arms".
Paraguay: Lino Oviedo's death and its consequences
Lino César Oviedo, retired general and Paraguayan politician who ousted dictator Alfredo Stroessner in 1989, died on Saturday, February 2, 2013 when the helicopter he was traveling on fell to the ground north of Asunción.
In the accident, his pilot and escort also died.

The blog La Oveja 100 reported on Monday, February 4:
The helicopter in which Lino César Oviedo was traveling was located today (03.02.2013) in a rural area of Paraguay, north of Asunción, with the bodies of its occupants calcinados , reported radio 780 am of Asunción.
A person from the closest circle to the presidential candidate's environment confirmed the death , said the station.
Oviedo headed the National Union of Ethical Citizens (UNACE), and ran for president in the general elections to be held on April 21, 2013, the sixth election held in the country since the coup d'état that ended the dictatorship in February 1989.
In this regard, the blog E'a Periódico de Interpretación y Análisis, gives a brief analysis of the Paraguayan political scene after Oviedo's death:
Oviedo certainly played an important role in the coup of 2 and 3 February 1989, but a moment of courage does not make anyone a hero, except when instead of courage what was probably fearlessness or when the moment could have reflected strict disagreements over spurious interests within the dictatorial power.
Heroism involves sustained behaviours that mark positive stories; trying to make a hero out of someone who hasn't had them can only sound like opportunism from those who, like birds of prey, fly over the remains...
InterParaguay's blog also re-enacts the government's announcement of three days of mourning for Oviedo's death:
Interior Minister Carmelo Caballero, at a press conference in Mburuvicha Roga, announced the government's determination to declare three days of mourning in official activities.
He also assured that the corresponding investigations will be done to determine the reason for the accident of the Robinson 44 helicopter that was moving to Oviedo and two more people.
Twitter users have also been expressing themselves through the microblogging network.
Fatima Garay (@fatimagaray) talks about the remains of the victims of the accident:
@fatimagaray: Medical team makes the greatest effort to deliver HOY remains of dead aerial entragedia to their family members including Lino Oviedo
And Anahí Tortorello (@anahitorto) asks him:
@anahitorto: @fatimagaray for today if or if the delivery of loa remains?
The user Klaus Hiebert (@KhaosXI) predicts:
@KhaosXI: Don't be surprised if in one of these new 200,000 or 500,000 notes we find Lino Oviedo's face printed on one of them.
Radio and television host Ismael Cala (@CALACNN) expressed his regret:
@CALACNN: My condolences to the family and supporters of #Lino Oviedo, whom I interviewed just six days ago on @CALACNN.
It's going on the air this Monday.
And then he makes an announcement:
@FernandaAzuaga: With the death of Lino Oviedo you don't play!
The Twitter tag #LinoOviedo is constantly updated.

Are you going to have your fingers amputated at Azadi Stadium?
Or will Islam forbid punishment for people who steal billions and only punish thieves?
Anadrbab has published five photographs of the Larijani brothers and compared them to The Dalton brothers, the fictional bandits from the Lucky Luke comics.
The blogger asked the same question:
Will Fazel Larijani be punished and his fingers amputated like everyone else's, or is the punishment only for thieves?
Slovakia: Critics support for hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics
While Norway and Switzerland plan to hold a referendum before submitting their proposal for the 2022 Winter Olympics, the fate of the joint proposal by Slovakia and Poland seems to have already been resolved: Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico expressed his support without waiting for government approval.
Slovakia's Olympic expenditure was initially estimated at €200 million, but the finance minister spoke afterwards of €300 million.
Others, for their part, estimate a figure close to €500 million.
Slovak NGOs such as the Fair-Play Alliance and opposition parties are demanding a precise cost analysis and a list of funding sources.
Economist Richard Ďurana considers that "the organization of the Olympic Games is a very expensive and short-term stimulus to national pride, which only very rich or very irresponsible countries can cope with".
Imrich Body, a member of the non-parliamentary 99 Percent-Civic Voice party (99 percent civic vote), sees the Olympics as another attempt to "feed the gorilla", referring to the corruption scandal that rocked Slovakia a year ago.
Blogger Matej Bórik has these questions for the Prime Minister:
How will they ensure that there is no overcrowded stage like London, Athens, Sochi, Vancouver and other mega cities?
Do you have enough money in your personal account?
Blogger Samo Marec wrote:
Notice that we have already fought for the Olympics - twice. No one may support my opinion, but I am convinced that the only purpose is, once again, to privatize public money.
Compared to this plan, he's a poor amateur.
On the other hand, blogger Karol Šebo is optimistic:
It is Poland, not Slovakia, that will play the leading role in convincing the International Olympic Committee.
Poland, which successfully organised Euro 2012; Poland, which has a strong influence in numerous organisations around the world.
And not to mention that Krakow has a strong international image.
That is why I think that this joint candidacy has a great chance of success, and any good result will give Slovakia the chance to become more visible, something that does not happen often.
For his part, blogger Tomáš Bosák expressed:
A bid to host the Olympics now, when we're languishing? Why do we need the Olympics?
Because I remember the show that was set up and how it got more expensive.
Now, building a single stadium wouldn't be enough.
I don't know, it reminds me of the May Day celebration.
There's no calculations, no documentation, but let's do it, because people will have fun.
And we'll have a chance to brag.
Mikuláš Huba, environmentalist and re-elected MP, wrote:
Nature is threatened, because Tatras are not the Alps.
Not give money to doctors and teachers, but do give it to officials, politicians, developers and sponsors?
Candidate for the Olympics is a very delicate decision that cannot and should not be made by one person in one day; it requires a serious, prolonged and informed debate not only in parliament but in society as a whole, following Norway's example.
The Prime Minister has openly shown that he takes public finance consolidation seriously and what (and who) are his priorities.
Resources: Open video course
For those who develop, edit and use video, P2PU (Peer to Peer University) recently created a short course on open video creation.
This course was conceived as part of the Open Video Forum in December 2012 at xm.lab.
The free digital course, which takes 15 hours, teaches you to understand video files, encoding, subtitling, video to web, video and HTML, encryption and metadata.
The aim of the project is to eventually create an Open Video Manual, which was inspired by the needs of the Mokolo Lab Project.
Named after the largest open-air market in Yaoundé, it was conceived as a way to integrate existing digital information about the African film industry with the goal of increasing the exposure of filmmakers and their works in Africa and the diaspora.
It is currently setting up a digital platform to distribute information and facilitate the network through a single portal.
The developers of the P2PU Open Video used a process they called "fast course" to create the online course in a weekend.
This methodology is based on the concept of "fast book", originally developed by Floss Manuals, which places for a few days a group of innovators in a room to work intensively, culminating in a final product of a book or manual.
Here, this process was used to create a digital course.
During the fast course, Mick Fuzz, who facilitated the activity, wrote a blog post to describe the course process, because he believes "this methodology can be useful for the emerging group of online educators who create digital educational resources (OERs)".
In the second half, we delve deeper into examples of using open video on the web, moving video metadata and getting into manipulating video command line and frames in Datamoshing, which is a surreal but fun way to learn about how digital video works.
You can find more information about the course creation process on P2PU's blog and about specific activities used during production.
In P2PU, they also encourage reviews and feedback from the open video course.
A PDF version is also available.
P2PU also hosts many other courses at its School of Open, including how to write featured content on Wikipedia, Find the perfect photo through free digital resources, Use open source software to add audio to video, and how to handle copyright regarding open data.
Free cell phones for Nigerian farmers?
In late 2012, the Nigerian Ministry of Agriculture made public plans to provide mobile phones free to rural farmers.
According to this report:
Ibukun Idusote, Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, reportedly said the Federal Ministry of Agriculture would procure ten million mobile phones, worth about N60 billion, from China and the US for free distribution to farmers across the country.
This has sparked reactions in the Nigerian blogosphere. Kikiowo Ileowo asks where the government got the statistics - which justify 10 million mobile phones for 10 million farmers - from:
The question is... where exactly are the 10 million farmers?
If your answer is first, what exactly do they produce so that Nigeria has not become a hub for everything related to food production?
Now, consider that a large part of food production in Nigeria is done through mechanized agriculture that uses less labor.
The "farmers" to whom the President wants to provide phones are subsistence farmers who produce what they consume mainly in their homes.
I have a garden in the back of my house, does that give me the right to be a beneficiary of a Jona-phone?
I see no reason why the president, along with his agriculture minister, would insult the collective intelligence of Nigerians with a noble idea in the face of the gallery that has revolutionized countries like Uganda, Kenya and India.
There has been a correction since then on the actual cost of phones:
Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Akinwunmi Adesina, has corrected the report in which the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Mrs. Ibukun Odusote, said that the phones would be bought by the government at the price of N60 billion, his explanation (was) that the phones will be supplied to farmers through public private collaboration...
Dr Akinwumi Adesina, Minister of Agriculture of Nigeria
Dr Adesina, Minister of Agriculture, stood up in defense of the project.
In a press release, he said:
When I arrived as Minister of Agriculture in July 2011, I found a corrupt and totally inefficient fertilizer sector.
The government was spending huge amounts of money on direct procurement and distribution of subsidized fertilizer, but less than 11% of farmers obtained the fertilizer.
Some of the government-paid fertilizer was never delivered to the warehouses.
Some of the fertilisers delivered contained more sand than fertilizer, while much of the government-subsidized fertilizer made its way across borders with neighboring countries, where it is sold at market prices.
This technology-mediated solution, he argues, put an end to the corruption associated with the distribution of fertilizers:
We ended four decades of corruption in the fertilizer sector within 90 days of my inauguration as minister.
How did we do it?
We were able to provide subsidized fertilisers and high-quality seeds to our rural farmers by introducing the GES (Growth Enhancement Support) system in April 2012.
The GES system provides inputs (fertilizers and seeds) to farmers directly through the use of farmers' mobile phones.
We created an electronic platform (e-wallet) where we register farmers and agricultural traders who own stores selling agricultural supplies across the country.
To date, 4.2 million farmers and nearly 900 agricultural distributors have been registered.
The minister believes that although many Nigerian farmers are illiterate, they are able to use mobile phones:
Some think our farmers are uneducated and can't use cell phones.
The evidence does not support that claim.
Under the GES system, we have made it possible for farmers to conduct business in their own local languages using their mobile phones.
Data collected from the use of cell phones by farmers to access fertilizers and seeds last year shows that the total number of telephone transactions in respect of the GES system was 4.9 million.
Of these, 1.2 million were in English, 620,000 in Pidgin, 2.2 million in Hausa, 854,000 in Yoruba and 344 in Igbo.
Based on this data, we have no doubt that our farmers are perfectly capable of using cell phones.
Technology, according to Dr. Adesina, helped him conclude that there would be no food crisis after the floods swept through some areas of the country:
When the floods came, there was panic in the country... I didn't worry.
We use modern technology to guide our decision.
Using remote sensors and satellite imagery, the extent of the flooding was mapped and determined that no more than 1.17% of our cultivated area was affected by the floods.
Our detractors wanted the world to believe otherwise, that the food crisis was imminent.
They were wrong.
Today, five months after the floods, we don't have a food crisis.
However, some internet users still have unanswered questions.
Olusola Adegbeti asks:
So one must ask pertinently, even if it is a rhetorical question, whether the purchase and distribution of GSM phones to hundreds of farmers scattered across a country as large as Nigeria is the most critical and difficult of the problems plaguing the Nigerian agricultural sector right now.
As a result, it is fitting to say that it is not necessary to have Solomon's wisdom or Isaiah's prophetic vision to be guided in the direction of the multitude of problems that have since made the agricultural sector miserable, such issues as lack of access to farmland, the absence of reliable and corruption-free financial institutions to empower farmers to acquire the machinery needed for modern mechanized and commercial agriculture that is usually the backbone of every nation, the lack of easy access to the technology and agrochemical support structure necessary for sustainable annual and perennial cultivation, as well as animal husbandry....
The Sun asks if farmers really need new mobile phones, when they already have one or have other sources of information:
The telephone is clearly not the best way to reach farmers who mostly live in rural areas.
Rural information centres, traditional communication models and radio are much better channels.
There are also many initiatives more direct than the provision of telephones through which the government can boost agricultural production in the country.
More importantly, the government does not have to buy phones for farmers because those of them who could use them already have them.
With phones for sale in the country at prices as low as N2000 to N3000, any farmer who deserves that name can afford to own one, and most likely already has one.
If not, what the government has to do is give them the possibility of being able to afford such a basic tool.
Disu Kimor thinks it's another useless project:
These useless projects will only reinforce Nigeria's perception of the rest of the world laughing at us, where we like to teach sign language to the blind.
Any developing country like Nigeria, which wants to develop its agricultural sector will focus on direct government intervention to help farmers and boost food production on achieving a stable supply of working capital, improving research and development, water supply, ensuring low fuel and labor costs, subsidy (without corruption) for agricultural machinery and basic infrastructure.
Disu concludes:
One day, posterity will judge the quasi-autonomous governmental bodies and political leaders of this country, whose main concern is to keep the country on its knees or to squander and waste so much needed public funds.
Dancing to the beat of history with marrabenta in Mozambique
This post was first published on Afribuku, a blog about contemporary African culture.
It is often said that Mozambicans start the year "marrumbling".
That's because every year, in early February, the country's most representative festival, the Marrabenta Festival, takes place.
Everywhere you go, you hear "teka, teka! , the expression used while dancing is ferocious, it has a contagious rhythm and it becomes difficult not to get carried away.
But in Mozambique, talking about the music of the beat is also something serious, because at every hypnotic rhythm, it resonates with the colonial past and the identity of the country.
The Marrabenta Music Festival This time, from February 1 to 3, 2013, the famous Congolese composer and singer Sam Mangwana and other Mozambican musicians such as Dilon Djindji, Radio Marrabenta, Xidimingwana, Orquesta Djambo or Cheny Wa Gune, performed at the sixth edition of this festival held in the city of Maputo and in the villages of Marracuene and Matalene.
As every year, a train with live music left from Maputo and brought free musicians and audiences to the village of Marracuene.
An hour and a half away on the "Marrabenta Train", people also joined in the celebration of Gwaza Muthini, which coincides with the date.
It's a train of twitches.

Resistance music
The Gwaza Muthini ceremony commemorates the famous Battle of Marracuene, which took place on February 2, 1895. In this battle, the warriors of the Gaza Empire, under the command of Ngumgunhane, resisted the Portuguese colonial army.
The men of Ngumgunhane lost the battle and this was the beginning of the end of the Gaza Empire.
In the past, a hippopotamus was hunted and its meat was distributed among the population to commemorate the date.
Today, hippopotamus meat has been replaced by goat meat, which is often enjoyed with a local drink called "canhu" - consumed while dancing to the sound of the marrabenta.
The history and evolution of the marrabenta was not easy.
It emerged in southern Mozambique in the late 1930s, but it wasn't until the 1960s that it became more popular.
Multiracial and multicultural policies within the Portuguese colonies in Africa facilitated its expansion in Mozambique and its cities.
The arrival of the first phonographs in South Africa and the emergence of local music broadcasts also contributed to their spread.

This is a photo of Quiroz afribuku.
Fighting music
The Portuguese regime in Mozambique demanded that only Portuguese music be sung and danced during most of the colonial period.
To defend their cultural identity, several organizations emerged, such as the African Association (AA) and the associative Centre of Negroes of the Province of Mozambique (CANPM), which ended up playing a fundamental role in promoting Mozambican culture.
In this way, marrabenta became a fight music whose themes are inspired by everyday life experiences, love, social criticism and important events that took place in Mozambique.
It's a good thing we're in the African Association (AA).
Photo from the personal file of Elarne and Fredo Cariano.
The evolution of the marrabenta
The rhythm was first played with homemade four-string guitars made from empty reed and wood pieces.
The mix of magikay and zukuta rhythms from the south of the country and the assimilation of Western rhythms such as black American and South African music that reached the ancient Lourenço Marques (now Maputo), enriched this new genre.
It didn't have a name until 1930, but it eventually adopted the name of marrabenta.
Sam Mangwana of the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire, when he was born) arrived at the festival for the first time this year.
Marrabenta Festival 2013. Afiche published in afribuku.
It's been five years since the first edition of the Marrabenta Festival, thanks to the initiative of Litho Sithoe.
And five years later, the festival continues through the determination and perseverance of its organizer.
On February 3, the festival ended with a concert at the Cultural Center of the city of Matalane.
This day is celebrated as "Mozambique Heroes' Day", a national holiday commemorating the lives of fallen soldiers who fought valiantly for the country's independence in 1975.
The final touch to end a weekend breathing, living and feeling great.
No one can predict the future of the brass band or figure out how the style will evolve in modern times, if it will take its path to a more commercial sound.
But what's clear is that in this sixth edition, entertainment was guaranteed.
Bangladesh: All roads lead to Shahbagh
Thousands of protesters continue to occupy the main intersection of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, demanding the death penalty for Abdul Quader Mollah, an Islamist Party leader and other individuals tried for war crimes committed during the 1971 liberation war.
It's been 42 years since the defendants were brought to trial.
Many of them are currently politicians of the Jamaat-e-Islami Islamist Party and say they will not back down until they consider justice done.
Since it was Friday and a public holiday, a large crowd was expected to join the protests.
At three o'clock in the afternoon, a mass rally led by young people would take place in Shahbagh.
The Network of Bloggers and Activists, Cultural Activists and Youth Organizations would be heading to the mass gathering.
No slogans/speeches would be allowed.
Political organisations were asked not to carry political banners.
The organizers asked students from Faculties and Institutes to join.
Shahbagh's protests would be broadcast live by young activists Shourov Hassan, Mahmudul Amin and Fahim Mahmud.
You could watch the live broadcast here.

On Friday, February 8, 2013, thousands of people began to gather at the Shahbagh Chottor Square in solidarity with the ongoing protests of bloggers and online activists.
At 3:00 p.m., the massive congregation in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka, began singing the national anthem.
It is really hard to say how many people gathered to peacefully protest that day.
Many felt that nearly 200,000 people joined in solidarity with the protest for tighter penalties for war criminals.
The Network of Bloggers and Activists Online has been leading these protests continuously since Tuesday, February 5.
Many students, teachers, freedom fighters, civil society leaders and families of war martyrs joined the protest.
The protesters are sharing their demands and news of different protests through an informational website titled Shahbag.org.
On that site, they also report on protests around the world in solidarity with their demands.
You can get updates by following the hashtags #Shahbagh and #Shahbag on Twitter.
You can also watch the protests in Shahbag, which are being broadcast live intermittently.

13-year-old Saudi girl receives an iPad after being infected with HIV
Reham al-Hakami, a 13-year-old girl, was infected with HIV after receiving a blood transfusion at a hospital in Jizan, southern Saudi Arabia.
In the Riyadh office blogger Ahmed Al Omran explains:
The case generated outrage on social media where many users asked for the Minister of Health, Abdullah al-Rabeeah, to resign his post.
Al-Sharq newspaper reported that the minister visited Reham at the King Faisal Specialized Hospital and Research Center on Saturday and gave him an iPad as a gift, a gesture that drew much mockery on Twitter.
The storm of reactions on the #الربيعة_يهدي_رهام_ايباد tag, which translates as "al-Rabeeah gives Reham an iPad", is overcome by this tweet from Summer, which has been retweeted 1,715 times and says:
@Haifa_: What will happen if she dies?
Olfat Gushgari has a similar idea:
@olfatg: What happens now?
A MacBook for paralysis caused by an error in an amazing #surgery
And @7iat_20 wonders why the girl hasn't been sent for treatment outside the country?:
@7iat_20: The health ministry's budget is 86 billion Saudi Riyals (NdT: 10 Saudi Riyals=38 US$) and they give you just an iPad instead of sending it to a specialized hospital to treat it?
Bassam Altamimi adds:
@BASSOOME: The future plan of the Ministry of Health is to give an iPad to all victims of medical errors if they are alive and to their relatives if they are dead.
As Suleiman Alosaimi projects new profits for Apple, the company that makes the iPad, saying:
@bofares_55: North American markets predict a huge increase in profits from selling Apple products due to medical practice errors in Saudi Arabia.
And Khaled Aldhaheri adds:

Radio and the Internet to help African farmers
On the anniversary of World Radio Day, we published a post about how interactions between the Internet and traditional broadcasting radio organizations can create more effective radio programs.
With high access and low production costs, says Farm Radio International (FRI), traditional open radio is the technology that best suits the needs of the countryside.
Working to reach farmers in sub-Saharan Africa is working with a population with a 3% Internet access rate versus 76% access to radio technologies (says Farm Radio International website.)
Although digital resources cannot reach farmers directly, traditional broadcasting can be supplemented to make it more effective, and the IRF has launched a series of online resources for use by regional broadcasters across the continent...
Barza is an online community in Africa that includes a peer-run forum, audio sample clips, and a long list of pre-written radio scripts in several languages (English and French and recently Swahili and Hausa).
Lilian, a broadcaster in Tanzania, uses "Frontline SMS" to send text messages to her FRI-laden audience.
These scripts already made vary in their themes from broad (e.g. storytelling and gender equality) to very specific (how to improve food security for Ugandans.)
A group of listeners to Radio Masaai in Moro Goro, Tanzania
A greeting script from Mega FM of Uganda, which carries out peace-building activities in a region brutally divided by the Lord's Resistance Army.
After the protracted war that led to the cutting down of many fruit trees, Mega FM collaborated with Radio Farm International to promote fruit tree cultivation and improve food security - in conjunction with supporting radio programs about tree care.
This was coupled with the ICT-mobile phone messages that alerted farmers to the upcoming transmissions.
RFI focuses on interactive programming, with quotes and discussions about policies and products among local farmers, not just top-down information.
Akot Janet is a farmer who participated in the program, she was asked if she had benefited from receiving market prices via SMS messages.
She replied: "I used to sell my crops at a very low price, just because I had no idea how the market was moving.
I was often confused when dealing with merchants.
I thought I should take the first offer the merchant offered.
This information about growing fruit trees has given me a lot of encouragement to start planting trees and improve my income.
I have a good number of mangoes and papaya trees, but I didn't know that I could make a living from fruit.
Partners in the field of work with Farm Radio International
FRI also offers training opportunities, including an 11-week e-course last fall open to Sub-Saharan African broadcasters on designing an effective program to help farmers, as well as weekly trainings on various topics (discussed in the forum) around radio storytelling.
FRI works with Search for Common Ground and Radio for Peacebuilding Africa and prepares a series of ten modules on management and operations at community radio stations to build capacity.

Wikipedia, copyright and freedom of expression on the internet
Note: This article was originally published on the Digital Rights website.
It's no exaggeration to say that Wikipedia has revolutionized the way we create and access information, showing a sustainable and collaborative model of intellectual work and understanding phenomena such as intellectual property.
This platform has made it possible for us all to relate to knowledge in a different way and has also put in place closed models of access to knowledge.
In this new testimony from #NotemasaInternet about copyright on the network, we spoke with Osmar Valdebenito, president of Wikimedia Argentina (and former president of its Chilean version), a foundation that is responsible for coordinating and making Wikipedia's infrastructure possible globally.
We talked with him not only about how Wikimedia works, but how freedom of expression on the web is fundamental to its development and how initiatives that seek to be even stricter with copyright on the Internet (SOPA, PIPA, etc.), would make it impossible for Wikipedia to exist as we know it.
Video: A course on Islam for humanitarian organizations
This post is part of our Global Development special coverage.
A constant debate in the Uncultured Project has been the relationship between a lack of knowledge about what Islam is and how cooperation and development organizations are related to the Muslim community.
Shawn Ahmed has shared a video that explains, briefly and simply, what Islam is all about to try to pave the way for understanding a large group of people who might receive help.
In Shawn Ahmed's April 7, 2012, post Cooperation, Cynicism and Islam, he referred to another Muslim post explaining what Islam consists of and excludes cynicism as well as respect for others.
I hope that more cooperatives (especially those who work in countries where there are many Muslims) understand this and respect it.
In a November 2012 post on Islam and the Internet Cooperation and Development Discourse, Ahmed reflects how discussions about internet cooperation exclude minorities, even those minorities who are the subject of the same cooperation initiatives in question.
He considers that one of the reasons for this exclusion could be that the tone of these cooperation talks does not reflect cultural norms, and this could be influencing the bad image that the cooperative industry is generating, especially in the case of a Muslim-majority country like Bangladesh:
If the co-operatives agree and applaud that tone... then maybe they're right.
In another post from the Uncultured Project: Islam:101, Ahmed proposes that a greater understanding of the culture of the communities in which cooperation organizations focus could provide these same organizations with a better environment where, instead of rejecting some work with certain groups due to ignorance and discrimination, they could learn the culture and work from this basis.

Don't get me wrong, "It's Colombia, not Columbia"
In an attempt to clarify the matter and resolve a common writing error among English speakers, four young Colombian professionals from digital innovation company Zemoga launched the social media campaign "It's Colombia, NOT Columbia".
As Richard Emblin explains in a post for The City Paper:
We're geographically far from British Columbia and an era of shuttles that surpassed many missions after the Columbia disintegrated over Texas in 2003.
And yet, many still make mistakes.
There are no Rocky Mountains in Colombia.
We're in the Andes.
But the campaign's mission goes beyond getting people to spell the country's name correctly.
Paul Giles explains in the Colombia Travel blog:
The campaign Es Colombia, not Columbia  is gaining momentum in a sustained way in its crusade to show how to write the country wrong only highlights how biased the popular concept of this amazing country is.
Emilio Pombo, one of the campaign's founders, told Edgar Zúñiga of NBC Latino:
We saw this common mistake and realized it was a platform to start updating our worldview of what's happening in our country.
Great things are happening to us right now.
Colombia is becoming a destination and appearing on the world stage.
We want to highlight that and it all starts with people writing our country's name right.
A social media campaign wants you to say it right: "It's Colombia, not Columbia".
Image widely shared on Twitter and Facebook.
Those sympathetic to the campaign are encouraged to participate by creating an image or video to spread the message.
Participants can then share their contributions on Twitter or Instagram with the #itsColombiaNOTColumbia tag, or upload their work to the campaign's Facebook fan page.
Positive messages about Colombia and images with the message "It's Colombia, not Columbia" have been coming to the label and Facebook page.
"Shakira, the woman who taught you that hips don't lie, she's from Colombia, not Columbia!"

@LordLeonMachi: We have a message.
We all have something to say. #itsColombiaNotColombia @OdeColombia #Colombia #Guajira #message pic.twitter.com/U1qCytAq
And @YatsarEl, from the city of Bucaramanga, invites web users to visit their country:
@YatsarEl: A place where old dreams are coming true, where people work hard and smile a lot.
Much has changed, dare to come! #itsColombianotColombia
But the campaign has not been free of criticism or jokes.
Nicolás Martínez (@diarionocturno) and others have been playing with the campaign slogan:
@CaroRuizG: What good is it that they say Colombia and not Columbia if everything else remains the same.
We need to change the background more than the form.
While El gato (@elgatoninja) tweets ironically:
@elgatoninja: The important thing is not that they stop the kidnapping, killing or starving people.
And Paula Ricciulli (@RicciuP) writes:
@RicciuP: If you say "Chinese" to all Asians, you have no right to complain because they call Colombia "Colombia".
The Facebook page of "It's Colombia, NO Columbia", launched on February 7, 2013, had more than 10,000 users at the time this post was published.

China: interactive maps of the most polluted and least polluted places
This article, written by Eli Bildner, first appeared in the Tea Leaf Nation on February 20, 2013 and is republished as part of a content sharing agreement.
Nearly five weeks ago, Beijing experienced the worst air quality day on record: PM2.5 levels  small particles that can cause lung, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases  rose more than 30 times above the level that the World Health Organization considers safe.
Air quality in China  Instant
Since then, there have been reports of the air apocalypse alongside what appears to be a black and white image of the country's iconic cities Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, all wrapped in a thick toxic fog.
In fact, China's most popular and prosperous cities are among the epicentres of the latest pollution crisis.
In Tianjin, for example, PM2.5 levels affected 577 people on February 9, the eve of the Chinese New Year.
In Beijing, sales of New Year's fireworks fell 37 percent after the municipal government asked residents to limit use.
But air quality in China is also a national problem  a difficult situation affecting cities with less recognition than Beijing or Shanghai.
Last week, Peoples Daily reported that 74 major cities, which the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection monitors, reported on February 10, the first day of the Chinese New Year, about "excessive" concentrations of PM2.5.
And as a glance at pollution, the figures this morning (February 20) show that dangerous air conditions continue throughout China, from Urumchi (with a PM2.5 concentration of 511 micrograms per cubic meter, or 20 times the recommended limit) to Canton.

Thailand: Surprising election victory for the opposition in Bangkok
Sukhumbhand Paribatra of the Democratic Party was re-elected governor of Bangkok despite predicting his election defeat.
Bangkok Pundit gives a first analysis of the vote:
F. The independents' vote falls to less than 300,000 or 11.28%.
As is happening at national level, Thailand is becoming a bipartisan system.

Using the #bkkvote tag here are some of the reactions from Thai netizens:
@Tinapotjanank if I was from Bangkok I would have voted for Suharit (No. 17), congratulations to Sukhumbhand, four (boring) more years...
@tulsathit Oh, before I leave, the much-mocked Sukhumbhand seems to have surpassed Sundaravej's record as the highest vote-getter.
@veen_NT Historical voter turnout in Bangkok: 64% - good job Bangkokians, try harder next time.
@Saksith If I'm not mistaken Bangkok and another province are the only ones where the Governor is elected, in the others he is appointed.
The atmosphere at the Pheu Thai Party headquarters on Petchburi Street became unpleasant for some Pongsapat supporters who pierced a television screen, shouted obscenities and pointed with their fingers at the face of MR Sukhumbhand Partibatra who was delivering a victory speech, live, in the Democratic party offices.
Various electoral bodies must now carry out a serious examination of conscience and seriously review their polling techniques which have been shown to be flawed.
It will take some time for confidence in these well-known surveys to be restored.
It must be admitted that it is unfair and unprofessional to blame everything on respondents who have been accused of lying to volunteers seeking their opinion.
The Bangkokians have spoken out loud with a turnout of almost 64%, much higher than in the last election, despite the showers that afternoon in certain constituencies.
Ecuador decrees three days of national mourning over Chávez's death
President Rafael Correa (@MashiRafael) of Ecuador has declared three days of national mourning following the death of Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.
In the press conference he delivered from the Carondelet Palace, Correa said that "those who fight for life cannot declare themselves dead".
The Head of State said that with the passing of Chávez, Latin America has lost a great leader and affirmed that those who fight for their homeland cannot be forgotten.
In honor of his departure, his life, Ecuador decrees three days of national mourning.
From where you are, dear Hugo, our commitment not to step back, for this Great Patria in which our liberators dreamed, said President Rafael Correa.
Activist Monica Chuji (@Monicachuji) wrote on Twitter:
Why are Russian journalists resigning?
When the socio-political website OpenSpace was shut down in February, some claimed it was an action against its editor-in-chief Maksim Kovalsky.
This made sense to many, as before running OpenSpace, Kovalsky ran the newspaper Kommersant Vlast '(Poder), from which he was removed for publishing a photograph of a presidential ballot marked with the words "Putin, go to hell" (Kommersant's CEO, Demian Kudryavtsev, left the company in protest shortly after this incident).
Now, less than a month later, there are new layoffs.
Two editors-in-chief lost their posts on March 4, 2013: Mikhail Kotov left one of Russia's largest online newspapers, Gazeta.ru, while Alexey Vorobiev is no longer head of Kommersant FM, a radio station affiliated with Kommersant with a strong online presence.
It's hard to overlook the similarities, where the most important is the fact that both editors were fired on the same day by a man named Dmitry Sergeev.
Indeed, there are two high-level media executives named Dmitry Sergeev in Russia, and they chose the same day to make a radical change to their staff, prompting a Twitter user to joke "the Russian media have set up a special post - Dmitry Sergeev".
One of these Dmitry Sergeevs, a senior official at SUP (the parent company of Gazeta.ru and LiveJournal) explained his part of the story in a Facebook post, citing a company planning session during which he sidelined Kotov:
This morning, in the planning session, I was appointed executive director of Gazeta.ru with direct supervision of all departments.
Previously, all departments were subordinate to the editor-in-chief and he was responsible for everything that happened in Gazeta.
Now, according to the new chain of command, the editorial, marketing and sales departments are my direct subordinates.
Mikhail Kotov categorically disagreed, said he could not continue working under these conditions and asked to resign.
Afterwards Sergeev explained, and recorded that the productivity of the publication was falling behind, and that they published "100 news a day".
He also mentioned that he had no desire to change the editorial direction of the newspaper.
However, according to Anton Nosik (former SUP worker), faced with that ultimatum, Kotov had no choice but to resign.
Although Gazeta.ru is not particularly opposed in spirit, Kotov's relative independence (he was in charge for more than a decade) was apparently seen as a threat by the owners.
- Why? - I don't know.
The journalist Vladimir Shusharin thought of an answer:
I have said and written repeatedly that these days quality journalism, especially economic journalism, is sharper, deeper, smarter and, ultimately, more oppositional than the pathetic and mediocre performance of those who have taken on the mantle of democratic opposition.
The other Dmitry Sergeev, president of the Kommersant publishing house, stayed away from social media, explaining to newspapers that Alexey Vorobiev resigned for "personal reasons".
He also mentioned an important point, that the editorial line of Kommersant FM would not change.
Although true, some see Vorobiev's departure as the last nail in the coffin of the old rebel radio station.
After all, he was the deputy editor of the former editor-in-chief, Denis Solopov, who came out in the middle of last year amid accusations that Kommersant owner Alisher Usmanov did not like the government's criticism of the publication.
For those who are still unsure of the general significance of these resignations, the reaction of Boris Yakemenko, a former guard Putinist and brother of the founder of NASHI, should be most telling:
Photographer and blogger Alberto Rojas compares mural photos at "The Spanish Route" in Caracas, Venezuela.

The new pope, Jorge Bergoglio, is Argentine
Argentine Jesuit Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio is the new pope of the Catholic Church.
Starting today, March 13, 2013, Bergoglio will be known throughout the world as Pope Francis.
Internet users reacted quickly to the announcement that, for the first time in history, an Argentinian and Latin American will be the leader of the Catholic Church.
From Buenos Aires, Rodrigo Hernán Torres (@RodrigoH_Torre) wrote:
@RodrigoH_Torre: #Bergoglio is our new Pope FELICITATIONS!
And all the success in this new challenge and path that begins, is a historic moment.

@zamosta; Pope Francis is the second most famous Argentine to know the hand of God. http://bit.ly/KpI47u
Even the North American TV host Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) commented about Argentine football:
@piersmorgan: Now Argentina has the No. 1 Catholic and No. 1 soccer player on the planet. #Bergoglio #Messi
In a more serious tone, Caren Kalafatich (@CarenKalafatich) tweeted:
@CarenKalafatich: We are Argentines, and that is our essence: We celebrate a "Pope" because he is "Argentine" and we don't talk about #Bergoglio as a man and his conservatism
Several users, such as Guillermo Prein, question the new pope's alleged involvement in the Argentine dictatorship of 1976-1983.
Prein wrote (@GuillermoPrein):
@GuillermoPrein: The hip #Bergoglio elected pope despite his unexplained involvement in the last dictatorship and the siege of pedophiles like Grassi
In subsequent articles we will present a greater coverage of the reactions of the internet users and the analyses carried out from Argentina and Latin America.
Keep up with the news.
The Argentines, the government and Pope Francis
While the world waited for the election of a new pope, Argentines were thrilled to have an Argentine pope.
The arrival of white smoke in the Vatican announced that the decision had already been made: the first Jesuit pope and the first Argentine pope, Jorge Bergoglio - now Francis - will be the highest authority of the Catholic Church after Benedict XVI's resignation.
On Twitter, Argentines spoke through different labels, such as #Bergoglio, #HabemusPapam, #PrimerasPalabrasDelPapa, #LaBarraDelPapa, #FranciscoI, among others.
The reactions have been varied.
For many it was a surprise, as @JessyDelPino writes:
@LuuceroAguirre I can't believe it, I'm not a believer, or anything, but it's really a PRIDE to finally have a Pope as he has to be! #Bergoglio
In the blog De Políticas y Políticos, Rosa Alcántara reproduces an article about the tumultuous relationship between the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and the new pope.
The former bishop and the president have been at odds on a number of issues, including same-sex marriage:
One of the issues in which Cardinal Bergoglio confronted the government was the draft law on same-sex marriage.
On July 9, 2010, days before its approval, a note from Bergoglio was made public calling the gay marriage bill a "war of God" which envisaged gay people being able to marry and adopt children.
Another confrontation occurred during the commemoration of the May Revolution, an Argentine homeland date that every year includes the traditional Tedeum in the Buenos Aires Cathedral.
In 2008, however, the Argentine president decided to change the place.
The blog Radio Christianity comments on this fact:
Although the government carried out protocols for the change, the decision to take him to Salta, where an interfaith prayer will be held, caused unrest in ecclesiastical sectors.
President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner will also evade, as her husband did during the presidency, an interpelatory homily by Argentine prime minister, Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio, during the Tedeum on May 25.
Argentines also recall that during the surgical intervention carried out to former president Néstor Kirchner in 2010 Kirchner's relatives refused that the emissary of Bergoglio impart the sacrament to him.
Others, like Gladys Lopreto in the blog Equality Dignity, criticize the Argentine episcopate's reactions on issues such as abortion.
Meanwhile, far from politics, many Argentines celebrate the good news.

Global Voices special podcast: Habemus Podcast!
Hello, everyone, we welcome you to a special edition of the Global Voices Podcast.
On Tuesday, March 12, 2013, the college of cardinals met in the Vatican to elect the new head of the Roman Catholic church, following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on February 28.
On Wednesday night Cardinal Protodiakons went out to the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and uttered the words "Habemus Papam!" ("we have Pope!"), and presented Pope Francis.
With two African cardinals considered at some point to be potential successors to Pope Benedict XVI, we spoke to Steve Sharra and Abdoulaye Bah of our African team about the possibility of an African pope, the continent's expectations of the next pope, and why cardinals at this week's papal conclave might have played games like volleyball.

St. Lawrence celebrates Pope Francis, his most sacred breath
Argentine football has not been unlike the joy that has been caused by the appointment of Pope Francis, since His Holiness Francis is a fan and active partner of the San Lorenzo de Almagro club, better known in Argentina as the "curves" or the "cyclone".
The club's nickname, "wolves", is not accidental.
The Goal.com page explains the reason for the name:
The nickname is definitely not casual.
The term "corvos" is not a reference to the bird, but to the popular way of referring to the priests of the Catholic Church, who are covered with black basements.
When news broke that Jorge Mario Bergoglio had been elected as the new pope of the Catholic Church, the official Twitter account of the San Lorenzo club (@SanLorenzo) wrote:
@SanLorenzo: It is a pride for the Institution to know that the first South American Pope is a Partner of #SanLorenzo.
At the same time, the sports institution sent a letter of congratulations to Pope Francis.
If that were not enough, in the match of March 16, where they faced San Lorenzo de Almagro and Colón de Santa Fe, the players of San Lorenzo wore a commemorative T-shirt to Pope Francis.
Image from the official Twitter account @SanLorenzo
Before the match against Columbus of Santa Fe, the account El Papa es Cuervo (@ivannacasla) said:
@Ivannacasla: To watch the cricket match, let's go San Lorenzo, God and the Pope help us!
Anto Gaitan (@Ggaitan_anto), a fan of Boca Juniors, wrote in reference to the few tournaments the San Lorenzo club has won, and referred to the practice of placing a star for each cup won on the official shirt shield:
@Ggaitan_Anto: Lack of stars on the shield. #SanLorenzo left with the inscription d #PapaFrancisco on the jacket jaja @ArgEsDeBoca @HinchasXeneizes
San Lorenzo beat Colón de Santa Fe 1-0 and with one player less, and club fans, like @Mrrjoness, shared their joy:
@aletati2007: #let's go cyclone!! this is if it was our holy week!!!!
Hector Pappa (@hectorPappa) tweeted that in the Vatican they are on holiday, and for Felipe CQ (@FelCul) the only goal of the match was the pope's.
According to Diego Mendoza (@diegol_77), the triumph of St. Lawrence was Pope Francis' first miracle.
Venezuela: Ortega, the 'destabilizing' tweeter was released
Hugo Chavez is cold.
This is a photo taken on anticapitalistes.net.
The following table shows the results of the evaluation:
UPDATE: Lourdes Alicia Ortega Perez, the Venezuelan woman who was arrested last week after mocking Hugo Chavez on Twitter, was released from police custody on March 16.
She has since been released, but will appear before the Court every 30 days.
The Venezuelan authorities are likely to respond to political dissent and criticism with great sensitivity in the days following Chavez's death on March 5.
Ortega, who tweets with user @ulilou, sent the offensive tweet on March 9 in response to user @douglirodil who asked (perhaps in a joke) if the president had died.
@douglirodil is not but turned into a wax doll is  Lourdes Ortega P. (@ulilou) March 9, 2013
Last week Global Voices Advocacy covered the news about Ortega's arrest and noted intense activity on Twitter where many users rejected the notion that a tweet of this nature could be seen as "destabilizing" for the country.
Whether this requirement will be valid for a long time or whether Ortega will have to appear in court indefinitely is unclear.
A legal expert told Global Voices Advocacy that courts have made similar decisions in the past over facts related to "rumors" circulating on social media.
Human rights defenders generally agree that the universal human right to freedom of expression is only confirmed when individuals are free to exercise this right "without fear of reprisal".
Although Ortega will be technically able to continue to express her views freely online, the court's requirement indicates that her online behavior will be closely monitored, a measure that leaves her at least with some fear of future punishment.
Ortega's Twitter account remains active but she hasn't tweeted since March 12, prior to her arrest.
A look inside the Indigenous University of Venezuela
How does it feel to be a student at the University of the Indigenous of Venezuela?
Three students from the Department of Education and Communication recently participated in a workshop led by Rising Voices to learn how to make better digital photographs, upload them and share them on the Internet.
Thanks to the satellite connection of the University, which was provided by a government program called Infocentros, students can access the Internet to share images of the activities, facilities and stunning nature surrounding the 2,000 hectares of campus, located in the state of Bolívar.
To learn more about the University and the workshop held in February 2013, please read the Rising Voices post.

Twitter, a tool that turns Mexicans into "war correspondents"
Reporting on drug trafficking in Mexico can be deadly.
Journalists and citizens are threatened and even killed for reporting on the violence that has taken over the country.
Despite the danger, many Mexicans are using citizen media to report on shootings, persecutions, murders and arrests, filling a news vacuum that has been leaving the country's traditional media.
Sara Plaza Écija in Citizen Journalism summarizes the findings of a new study on the role of citizen media as 'new war correspondents' in Mexico.
Here we share Sara's article that is under a Creative Commons license Recognition 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0).

A US study, devoted to the analysis of digital innovation, reveals that Twitter users in Mexico have become the reliable source for reporting on issues related to drug trafficking in the country, taking on the role of traditional news media.
According to the document The New War Correspondents: The Age of the Civil Media in the Urban War , in cities like Reynosa, Monterey, Veracruz or Saltillo, Twitter users are responsible for reporting on arrests, shootings and clashes over drugs in Mexico, thus assuming informational characteristics of traditional media.
This information has become increasingly influential for Mexicans because of the lack of credibility of the country's mainstream media.
The research, led by Microsoft Research, examines the practices of information sharing by people living in cities in conflict over the war on drugs in Mexico.
It describes how often citizens use social media to alert others to violence in their communities.
In addition to researching the emergence of citizen media curators , i.e. citizens who act as war correspondents  with the dissemination of information.
It's a group of people, whom we call  curators , who have a large following on social networks, which means they have earned the trust of their community , says Andrés Monroy-Hernández, one of the authors of the research.
The study focused on the four cities most affected by violence, Reynosa, Monterey, Veracruz and Saltillo.
They looked for common traits in tweets, hashtags and Twitter users who shared the information.
Most tweets refer to a place, a city, and the word shots .
The tweets act as a public service advising citizens to stay away from certain neighborhoods.
Curators  contain a large number of followers and tweets.
It's about people finding information and sharing it.
The study notes that 61% of Mexicans use social media, but only 20% use Twitter.
About 4.2% of Mexico's online population has posted about the war on drugs or drug trafficking on Twitter, according to Monroy- Hernandez.
Violence in Mexico has increased because of this drug war and the media has become one of the targets, so some news outlets in the country have become cautious in reporting on these issues.
This is why, what the curators see as a need to report.
Investigators attempted to interview these new war correspondents , but some of them have remained anonymous for fear of taking the same risks as traditional journalists.
VIDEO: Fire at Ukrainian power plant, uncertain future of a village
At least one person died and five were injured on 29 March in a major fire at the Vuhlehirska thermal power plant in the village of Svitlodarsk in the Donetsk region of Ukraine.
About 12 hours later, the fire was still raging, the four power generating units at the plant were destroyed and the 12,000 inhabitants were left without heating, hot water and electricity.
Patients admitted to the local hospital were evacuated to the nearby city of Debaltsevo, according to LiveJournal user pauluskp (Pavel Kolesnik,) who lives in Donetsk, who has been playing videos and photos and sharing updates on the situation on his blog.
Kolesnik/pauluskp posted this video of the first few minutes of the fire, recorded by the plant workers at a time "when the flames still didn't seem so dangerous":
According to official information, the fire started around 3 pm. However, in a comment to the pauluskp post, hannaukr, a user of LiveJournal, writes that the fire actually started around noon, but the plant workers spent three hours trying to extinguish it on their own, before finally calling the firefighters.
The user kotya1975 of LiveJournal adds:
Unfortunately, the plant is now completely destroyed, and it is important not to allow the fire to spread to the adjacent buildings.
Kolesnik/pauluskp writes that the future of the city of Svitlodarsk, home to the damaged thermal plant, is one of the biggest concerns right now:
It doesn't seem likely they'll rebuild the plant. It could become another ghost town.
Neither the city itself could recover from the (catastrophic accident of 2002) coal mine.
Kolesnik/pauluskp links his own report with photos from Ukrainsk, which was later reproduced and translated into English by the English Russia blog.
Argentina: Floods in Buenos Aires kill 35 people
The heavy rains that have hit the province of Buenos Aires have left at least 35 dead and thousands injured.
EA2CPG blog reports on the climate phenomenon of April 2, which coincided with the holiday of Veterans Day and the Fallen in the Falklands War:
The city of Buenos Aires has about three million inhabitants.
More than 10 percent of the population has been directly affected by the latest rains, the most damaging in 107 years, according to authorities.
The Queen of Silver looked like Venice early Tuesday morning and will need many days to return to normal.
In the post "#Temporal:Relations of the Catastrophe", Revista Amfibia, among images of the tragedy, also publishes some testimonies of the victims published on Facebook, such as that of musician Gabo Ferro:
As this growth encountered streams that flow into the Rio de la Plata, they became entangled, their channel filled and the world ended.
Urban rent is a temptation that is difficult to avoid.
For a time these tubes withstood rain well, but as the natural absorbent surface continued to be built, it decreased and the volume of water that began to pass through there increased.
Finally, there are the sanitary fillings on the shore of the Rio de la Plata to gain surface for real estate purposes that increase the length of the tubing until it reaches the natural drainage.
Image shared by Gustavo Streger (@gstreger) on Twitter.
Meanwhile, the government of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner and the government of the city of Buenos Aires are also looking for culprits.
The national news agency Telam publishes the statements of the Federal Planning Minister, Julio De Vido:
Federal Planning Minister Julio De Vido said that the lack of management by Mauricio Macri's government makes us mourn fatalities and leaves 450 thousand residents without light in the city.
On the other hand, Comunas 24.com reports that the head of government of the city of Buenos Aires, Mauricio Macri, stated:
Macri recalled that more than four years ago the City requested those endorsements and clarified that the credit, "will be paid by the City integrally".

Since early 2013, an image has been circulating on social media with the caption "The batts are illegal", referring to the Colombian army's practice of detaining young people who are on the street without documents or who have no definite military status.
Madrid's president defends image censorship
The President of the Community of Madrid, Ignacio González (Partido Popular) has defended in the broadcaster Radio de Libertad Digital the establishment of "certain limits" to the publication of compromising images in the media because "we must take care of the damages to people and institutions".
These statements come days after El País published photos from 20 years ago, in which the president of the Xunta Galega, Alberto Núñez Feijóo (Partido Popular) appeared with the historic smuggler Marcial Dorado, currently in prison.
The Confidencial published statements by the president of the Xunta following the scandal:
I always said that there was nothing behind those photos, and that those photos were that, a few photos, and I also said that I was willing to continue explaining and explaining everything that came to my mind.
This "compromising image" was the one the President of the Community of Madrid was referring to when he proposed censoring the media in favour of maintaining the good image of government institutions.
The social media reactions have been unexpected, reaching trending topics on Twitter in a few minutes:
@ROMARIOIDEG: Ignacio González is forgetting something called: Democracy.
Which implies freedom of the press.
@tOnnijimenez: Where will freedom of expression be left by Ignacio González?
@LaMariMala: Ignacio González says that freedom of expression does not bother him.
@CristianMas86: Ignacio González is more about putting limits on the press that uncovers corruption than the corrupt ones themselves.

New methods for reducing poverty are being explored
Several Global Voices bloggers took charge of the live blogging of the OECD Global Forum on Development in Paris on 4 and 5 April 2013.
Prior to the meeting, our team published several articles on development issues to serve as content for weekly debates on their website (#OECDgfd)

As the 2015 deadline for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaches, the search for solutions to reduce poverty is on the rise.
Many organizations explore new answers in the hope that they will bring forth fresh ideas.
Among these goals agreed by the international community more than a decade ago was to halve the number of people who are hungry, and to get the world's poorest citizens productive jobs.
Many of the targets are far from being met in most countries, but progress has been made.
For example, in sub-Saharan Africa, where the proportion of people living on less than $1.25 a day fell from 58 percent to 51 percent between 1990 and 2005.
Exchange of ideas on the Internet
As every year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) will hold its Global Forum on Development in Paris on 4 and 5 April 2013.
This year, the OECD wants to explore more inclusive methods for tackling poverty, inviting an open online debate ahead of the forum with OECD researchers.
The main topics of discussion have been made public so that everyone can know about them and contribute.
Concerned African Scholars, an organization of African thinkers and students, hosts another interesting way of sharing ideas online.
Among the many issues being discussed is the impact of the billions of dollars that are illegally leaving Africa because of the slow pace of poverty reduction.
If Africa had not lost so many resources in the form of illicit financial transfers, poverty would likely be much less rampant.
Logic says that keeping these resources in Africa would have produced higher investment rates, allowing African countries to spend money on sectors that promote productivity, such as infrastructure, job creation and income growth, which would have resulted in lower poverty levels.
This strategy of involving different stakeholders is also a fundamental principle of the open data movement, which is gradually entering the development sphere.
The Uganda Open Development Partnership Platform, a public initiative rooted in civil society, is an example of what open data can contribute to the debate on poverty reduction:
Open development increases transparency and accountability about the resources that can be invested in development, how those resources are invested and the results they achieve.
In the end, all stakeholders involved in this information exchange  data owners and users  benefit from this mutually reinforcing ecosystem
Air show ends in aerial tragedy in Dominican Republic
During the second and final day of the Caribbean Air Show, just minutes after the start of the show, a T-35 Pillán aircraft, FAD 1807 registration, of Chilean manufacture and belonging to the Dominican Air Force (FAD), manned by the 1st.
Lieutenant Pilot Rafael Eduardo Sánchez Astacio, and 2nd Lieutenant Pilot Carlos Manuel Guerrero Guerrero, experienced problems during an acrobatics and rushed into the sea.
Less than two hours after the incident, the two dead bodies were found and taken to the Naval Base of the War Navy in Sans Soucí and from there transported in helicopters to the Military Hospital Docente Doctor Ramón de Lara, FAD.
According to the organizers, the Caribbean Air Show 2013 met all international standards set by the International Council of Airshows, for shows of this nature, being the same endorsed by these.
The President, Danilo Medina, quickly expressed his condolences:
@RaulRaful: That rescue team was a disaster.
Two tankless divers were going to find those bodies along with snacks from Boca Chica? #ShowAereo
@BartolomePujals: This dramatic event makes several things clear.
1) incompetence of rescue authorities; 2) indolence of organizers. #OJO
Some communicators and social media users claimed that the plane was not fit for aerial acrobatics, to which the communicator and politician, José Laluz, replied:
Chadian blogger arrested
Internet Without Borders reports that Jean Laokolé, a Chadian blogger and writer, was arrested on March 22 by security forces in Yamena, the capital of Chad.
In a petition published on Tuesday, April 9, the advocacy group writes: "He was stopped by a group of men dressed in country clothes while driving with his family".
The petition calls for the blogger's "immediate and unconditional release".
Laokolé writes under a pseudonym for one of Chad's most popular blogs.
Since his arrest, Laokolé has been held without trial in an undisclosed location, explains Julie Owono, of the Office for Africa for Internet Without Borders.
Owono writes:
Jean Laokolé contributed last year under a false name to Chad's famous blog http://makaila.over-blog.com/.
In his articles, he denounced the corruption, mismanagement and nepotism that prevail in this country located in central Africa.
He was identified by the intelligence services.
Jean Laokolé (graciously photographed from Internet Without Borders)
Laokolé was last seen on March 25 near a military camp, known as "Camp Amsinene".
Local human rights activists told Internet Without Borders that the camp is known for housing political prisoners.
In 2012, Amnesty International documented routine human rights violations in Amsinene.
According to Amnesty International, Laokolé comes from a politically active family that has been targeted by authorities in the past.
His father, Jean-Baptiste Laokolé, is a leader of the political opposition and vice-president of a coalition of opposition political parties.
As for the possible motive behind Laokolé's arrest, Internet Without Borders writes:
According to various sources, including his family members, police called Jean Laokolé... allegedly over an article posted on a blog.
He was suspected of making "false accusations" against a group of people who could file a complaint against him.
Negotiations were underway for a compromise solution between all parties: it was finally agreed that Jean Laokolé would write an apology on this blog and also send an apology letter to those who were harmed by the blog.
Talking to Marianna Breytman, translator at Global Voices
During the last Global Voices Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, I met some (relatively) new Global Voices contributors.
One of them was Marianna Breytman, who translates from Spanish into English, so she is an avid reader of what we publish in Global Voices in Spanish by Latin American and Spanish authors.
I spoke to her quite informally and in the following short video you can see (and hear her) talking about Global Voices, translations and languages:
After that we were in contact via email, via which we talked about the following:
Juan Arellano: You just passed the 100 translated posts barrier for GV, was it something you set out to do when you started?
Marianna Breytman: No, I'm not going to.
The truth is, when I started Global Voices, I didn't know where it was going to take me.
I was just doing the translations because it was something I liked to do, it was fun, like I told you in Nairobi.
The 100 posts thing came up when I was approaching my 2nd anniversary with GV (in March 2013) and I wanted to get 100 posts before that.
JA: Any of the translations you've done for GV have impacted you or do you have anecdotes related to them?
MB: The translations that really impress me are those that take place in places I've known. I remember a post Ariel had written about the "red devils" in Panama just after I had made my trip to that country.
I knew I had to translate that post because I had just had that experience of seeing them all over the city.
There's another post I remember from Robert about the protests in Brooklyn after the death of Kimani Gray.
I didn't even know this was happening in my own town until I took over the translation.
When Elaine was denied a visa (*) to come to the US, she posted a post on her blog with her reaction to it.
She wanted to spread it out and I immediately told her I'd translate it.
I was so sad to read his moving story and learn more about his situation, as a colleague and friend, that I was inspired to make the best translation I could.
At that moment, I realized the importance of doing translations to give a voice to people who want to tell their stories to the rest of the world.
That's why I love what I do.
JA: Since Spanish isn't your native language, how did you get interested in this language?
MB: Everyone asks me that, and I still don't have a good answer! I've been studying Spanish for many, many years, since I was a kid in elementary school, but I think the first time I got interested was when I was in the sixth grade, and I had a Spanish teacher who was an Orthodox Jew from Panama (that's the beauty of living in New York City!).
I think he saw something in me that I didn't even recognize and pushed me to keep learning the language.
Thanks to him, I started reading more, listening to more radio in Spanish, and taking advanced classes.
But learning Spanish never seemed like that.
I went to study it because I didn't feel like I was making a big effort to learn it.
I was just doing something I liked.
This is Marianna Breytman.
JA: Since you're a volunteer for GV, what other things do you do your time on?
I specifically work on the Au Pair program that gives opportunities for students living abroad to come to the U.S. to care for children and study at the same time.
My position is International Recruitment Coordinator, so I review all applicant applications and work with our international partners to help them spread the program in their country.
Besides that, I sometimes teach Spanish at a collaborative education center in Brooklyn.
JA: I read that you're very interested in gastronomy -- do you cook in your spare time?
MB: Where did you read that?!
I'm interested in gastronomy, but I don't cook as much as I would like, I'm very interested in trying out different countries.
I was in Panama for the first time in March (and I had the opportunity to visit another GV'er, the wonderful Ariel Moreno) and I ate my first ceviche.
JA: You're quite young, what are your plans for the future?
MB: For now, I would very much like to continue working in the field of international education.
I'm fascinated by this subject of mixing and coexisting cultures, which is why I love living in New York.
Then, for the future, I've thought about working for an organization that is dedicated to fighting for human rights and/or doing economic development projects.
I also want to continue teaching Spanish.
And obviously I look forward to continuing to work with Global Voices.
I'd like to diversify and learn more about other projects within GV as well.
In fact, I just did some translations for Eddie at Rising Voices and that gave me the opportunity to learn more about that part of the organization.
I have also been working voluntarily with WITNESS (one of GV's partners who makes videos to fight for human rights) for over a year and plan to continue helping them and translating for their initiatives.
In the following video we talked a little more about Global Voices and the meeting that led us to Nairobi.
JA: Anything else to add?
MB: Yes, thanks to Firuzeh and Silvia, I hope to continue to develop and grow as a translator with them.
The truth is, I never thought in my life that, as a volunteer translator, I would have the opportunity to be part of this GV family and meet so many amazing people who are changing the world.
It was a dream, really.

They question the hunger strike of an Iranian blogger
Mehdi Khazali, source: doostaranedrkhazali.blogspot.com
350 bloggers, political activists and Iranian civil society activists signed a joint letter last week warning that the life of the editor, physicist and blogger, Mehdi Khazali, was in grave danger after he had been on hunger strike for more than 90 days.
But while some bloggers warn that Mehdi Khazali's life is in danger, others question whether he is actually on hunger strike.
Khazali is the son of a prominent right-wing cleric and former Guardian Council member, Ayatollah Khazali.
He was arrested along with several participants in a writers' association called Saraye Ghalam.
Iranian blogger Freedomseeker explains the rumors:
...one of the main reasons people don't believe in Khazali's hunger strike is because more than a year ago it was announced that he had been on hunger strike for 67 days.
Shortly after being released on the orders of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, leader of the Islamic Republic, Khazali began his weekly mountain tours and urged people to participate in parliamentary elections.
In the photos that were posted on this tour, there were no visible signs of a prolonged hunger strike and he appeared in good shape...
His previous activities with the regime led some people to suspect that the regime was in the process of creating a false opposition.
Not everyone shares this view.
An online petition calls for the immediate and unconditional release of Mehdi Khazali:
Mehdi Khazali, an imprisoned Iranian blogger and physicist, has started the sixth day of the hunger strike in Evin prison.
He was last arrested in November 2012, after security forces stormed a writers' meeting.
Kaleme reports that Khazali broke off his previous strike when prison authorities promised to comply with his requests.
Irane Azad writes that the same people who joked about Mehdi Khazali's hunger strike, if he died tomorrow, would call him a martyr.
These people boycotted the 2009 presidential election but after the Green Movement (protest movement) emerged, they became front-line supporters.
A person is dying in prison".
Syria: Tweeting from the battlefront in Aleppo
Journalist Jenan Moussa is back in Aleppo, Syria, tweeting her experiences as the war between pro- and anti-government forces intensifies.
Moussa's tweets are raw and personal, giving readers a glimpse of what life is like for those caught in the crossfire.
Moussa, who is a traveling reporter for Arabic Al Aan TV, Dubai, UAE, notes:
@jenanmoussa: It's very nice to be back in #Aleppo and reunite with all my friends.
People adapted to war.
Dining in Aleppo is accompanied by the sound of mortars falling in the distance:
@jenanmoussa: It's time to eat here in #Aleppo.
We have chicken to the Mexican while the sound of mortars echoes in the distance.
After a night on the town.
Moussa asks himself:
@jenanmoussa: Good morning from #Aleppo.
I couldn't sleep until 6 a.m.
Every time I close my eyes, I imagine bombs falling.
God, how are people sane?
In Aleppo, visit the site where a Scud missile fell 45 days earlier.
I tweeted:
@jenanmoussa: I went to the place where a SCUD missile fell 45 days ago in #Aleppo.
There are six bodies lost under the rubble.
@jenanmoussa: In #Aleppo I saw a father with tears in his eyes, sitting on the rubble.

Photo shared by @jenanmoussa on Twitter
@jenanmoussa: While he was with him, the father found the child's shoes and a hair braid (female hair) under the rubble.
Despite the stressful situation, Moussa maintains his sense of humor:
@jenanmoussa: The activists in #Aleppo make me laugh.
Sometimes I'm the only one who wears her flak jacket at home.
They're used to the sounds of war.
And then they go to bed without dinner:
@jenanmoussa: We are not having dinner tonight.
It's not a necessity in a city like #Aleppo.
Good night to you all.
The Chinese media authorities have announced restrictions on media and other organisations reporting on unauthorised media coverage of foreign media.
The General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television announced the controls in an announcement published on April 16, 2013, less than a day after the New York Times announced the awarding of a Pulitzer Prize for press reporting on the hidden wealth of Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's family.
In response to this report, the Chinese government blocked the website of the newspaper "The New York Times", as well as the name of Wen Jiabao of Sina Weibo.
In addition to requiring authorization from Chinese media to use foreign news content, the regulations also prohibit organizations and journalists from sharing information on social media, such as the popular microblogging site Sina Weibo, which could not normally be included in publications.
The announcement, published by China's state-run Xinhua news agency, says:
All media outlets are not allowed to use information from foreign media outlets without authorisation.
It is strictly forbidden for journalists and publishers to use the internet as a platform to seek illegal benefits; such behavior will be investigated and punished according to the law.
To start an official Weibo account, news agencies must first inform the registry authorities and designate personnel responsible for publishing reliable information and erasing harmful information in time
Most of the stories on the international pages of the state newspaper are based on international news agencies.
According to The Telegraph, the ban on the use of foreign media could have a major impact on Chinese newspapers.
The news has sparked outrage among many Weibo users, especially among journalists.
The Beijing-based journalist, Qingdeng Xiaxiangmingbian wrote:
Internet in China by Karen Roach via Shutterstock
Public opinion oversight is essential for a healthy society, the scale of criticism is the scale of democracy, "if criticism is not free, praise is meaningless".
The correct conclusion is derived from a wide range of voices and not the one chosen by the authority.
Internet user Lida Suibi  questioned whether such media control is effective in the long run:
What is harmful information?
I think there's only true and false information.
The purpose of news is to spread the truth, which is the basic need of every society.
Most of the damaging information as defined by the propaganda department throughout the history of the Republic of China proved to be accurate.
Blocking information and opinions may be effective temporarily, but a policy of self-denial will not work in the long run.
Another internet user, "Yun Mu", echoed the sentiment in Chinese:
The more you try to hide, the more you're exposed.
"Ye Laodie aiLvse" wrote sarcastically:
The laws and regulations have been seriously lagging behind in the development of things!
Diversity of sounds at the Indigenous University of Venezuela
The University of Venezuela Indigenous (UIV) is known for its cultural diversity that brings together students from many indigenous communities across the country.
During the snack hour or when walking together between classes, students can be heard conversing in the different native languages represented at the IVU.
The preservation of language and culture remains an important pillar for IVF, and an example of this can be seen on its website.
The mission of the school is available in Huottöja, Pumé, Ye'kwana, Shiriana and E'ñepa languages.
Here is the translation into the E'ñepa language, also known as Panare:
A university that educates and awareness Indigenous youth to serve their communities.
We preserve and strengthen the culture of the Indigenous Peoples and propose an intercultural and experimental higher education of indigenous peoples.
Brewery raises kidnapping against Panamanian football federation
Despite a tweet from President Ricardo Martinelli that stirred the controversy, the waters are back on track after a few turbulent days between the Panamanian Football Federation and Baru Brewery,
On April 29, 2013 President Martinelli (@rmartinelli) wrote on his Twitter account referring to one of Baru Brewery's products:
@rmartinelli: I respectfully ask Cerv Panama to withdraw the lawsuit from Fepafut.
Their fight is against all of Panama and now it's with me.
The President's words raised both pro and against.
Joanna (@Buhenona) said the tweet promoted irresponsibility:

For Jesús Chucho Barrios (@chucho507), however, it is a show of love for the president's selection: @chucho507: @rmartinelli Definitive our President is not a Robot, he expresses and feels like any of us. #SupportAlPresi @la_cascara
Baru Brewery lifted its embargo against Fepafut on the morning of April 30, as reported by Diario Pro:
In a press conference convened on Tuesday morning, the manager of Beercería Barú, Helene Weesie, confirmed that they have notified the Panamanian Football Federation that the kidnapping they had stopped on Thursday has been lifted and that the process will resume after the 2014 World Cup.
The company also used the Twitter account of Cerveza Panama (@Cerveza_Panama), its main product, to announce that despite withdrawing the kidnapping they expect justice:
@Cerveza_Panama: Consumers want transparency and justice, so we too, so we will continue the arbitration process after the World Cup.

Spark13: Fourth world forum on telecentres
Rising Voices is pleased to announce that it will be a media partner at the Fourth World Forum on Telecentres to be held in Granada, Spain, from 28 to 29 May 2013.
This meeting called Spark 13 will focus on three main themes of discussion: People, innovation and sustainability.
Participants in the Global Telecentre Network, which consists of approximately 500,000 telecentres serving around one billion users worldwide, will be able to participate in small group sessions, workshops and other participatory activities to explore the topics of discussion.
According to Telecentre.org:
A telecentre is a public place where people can find information, create, learn and communicate with others, while developing digital skills through access to information and communication technology.
Organized by the Telecentre.org Foundation, Telecentres Europe, the Fernando de los Rios-Red Guadalinfo Consortium, and the National Agency of the Korean Information Society, Spark13 hopes to bring together 1,300 participants from around the world.
The winners of the Telecentre Global First Awards will be announced on Spark13.
Awards will be presented in the following categories: Telecentro, Telecentro Manager, Telecentro Network, Telecentros Iniciativa, Telecentro Innovación, Information and Access Centre.
Rising Voices has been very interested in how physical spaces, such as telecenters, libraries and hacker labs can be important resources for local communities as a way to foster citizen engagement through the use of digital media tools.
Providing access to the Internet is certainly an important step, but many of these spaces also provide important training and mentoring for users.
In August 2012, together with New Tactics and Social Media Exchange, Rising Voices organized an online dialogue called "Physical Spaces as Catalysts for Greater Digital Citizenship Participation".
During this virtual conversation, we gathered experts and other professionals to share their experiences, challenges and success stories:
Around the world, the new physical spaces that are emerging act as catalysts for greater citizen participation through digital technologies.
Community libraries are rethinking their traditional role, and many are offering internet access to their users in order to provide opportunities to meet on local issues, where they can produce and not just consume information.
Telecentres go beyond providing computer access to communities, they offer workshops to train citizens on how to use digital technology effectively to promote change.
Hacklabs offer a physical space where activists and technologists can come together to find innovative solutions to local problems.
These are just a few examples of the innovative use of physical space to encourage and enhance greater participation of digital citizenship.
Before, during and after Spark 13, Rising Voices will be presenting some of these innovative telecenters that are playing a major role in helping communities access local digital media tools to tell their own stories or participate more fully online.
Mozambique: Land development and appropriation programmes
Amid growing concern about "land ownership" in Africa and the transformation of the smallholder system into large-scale commercial agriculture, a controversial economic development plan was leaked and alarmed both Mozambique, Brazil and Japan, two key investors.
According to the Mozambican NGO "Environmental Justice" and other signatory organizations, a leaked copy of the so-called Master Plan of the pro-SABANA program dated March 2013, reveals plans for "land appropriation" by the governments of Japan, Brazil and Mozambique.

Brazilian activist Fátima Mello explains the pro-SABANA project and tells us the story of the program in an interview with the Humanitas Institute:
Pro SABANA is a cooperation and investment programme involving three countries: Brazil, Japan and Mozambique.
It is an agricultural plan comprising three provinces in northern Mozambique, a 14.5 million hectare region where about 5.5 million farmers live and produce their food within a family farm system.
Pro SABANA is derived from the Prodecer programme, which was developed in Mato Grosso, in the Brazilian "closed" area in the 1980s, with the cooperation of Japan and which had the characteristics we already know in the closed area: giant large-scale mono-culture soybeans for export, intensive use of pesticides, elimination of traditional crops, land concentration, soil pollution and the creation of economic power in land and agro-industries, which translated into political power...
The region, the "Nacala corridor", is the size of Switzerland and Austria combined.
The government and the bodies sponsoring this project had not yet shown maps where farmers and citizens in general could see the land that would be included.
The farmers' organisations were completely excluded from the design of policies and the project.
The National Union of Peasants of Mozambique (UNAC) declared last year:
We, the poor farmers, condemn the way in which the pro-SABANA programme was designed and the way in which it is intended to be implemented in Mozambique, as there was a lack of transparency and civil organisations were excluded from the process, especially farmers' organisations.
In Delegoa Bay's blog, a blogger named ABM writes:
Talking to the farmers of the Nacala corridor makes it clear that Brazilians and Japanese are visiting the communities to warn them that the Pro SABANA plan will begin to be implemented.
Then they'll say they consulted civil society.
What they're doing is not consulting.
In March, under increasing pressure, the Mozambican government declared that "dialogue must be permanent".
Brazilian diplomats responded to the transparency request by ensuring that the peasants will be included in the development plans of the Nacala corridor.
The director of the Brazilian Cooperation Agency, Fernando Abreu, said last month that more information about the project will be given and that there were no plans to displace the farmers from the land.
The leakage of the programme made it possible to know the maps showing the districts that will be allocated for large-scale agriculture for export purposes and allowed civil organizations to verify exactly which communities would be affected to have a clearer idea of the potential impact.
The document identifies seven areas of intensive development.
Environmental Justice and other signatory organisations describe the type of agriculture to be launched.
Some projects in the programme grant large areas of land to investors.
The grain-producing zone projected in the district of Majune in the province of Niassa will be managed by a vertical integration company that will manage nine farms of 5,000 ha each, in a region that has 60,000 ha in total, and will be turned into corn, soybean and sunflower crops, mainly destined for export.
The programme assures that 'the project has a high rate of return; the internal rate of return is calculated at 20.3% and the amortisation in 9 years'.
Organizations continue to wonder if there will be any benefit to Mozambicans in the region:
It is significant that only one of the seven regions of the Master Plan is for farmers and family production.
And in this area only the same old and wrong model of development of the green revolution is proposed.
The Master Plan has not taken into account the needs or capabilities of the peasants in the Nacala corridor.
Corporations are the major beneficiaries of the Master Plan.
They will have control over the land, production and trade of the food produced, which will be transported through the roads, trains and the port of Nacala, which other foreign corporations will build with public funds from Mozambique and Japan.
The National Union of Peasants predicted last year that many problems would arise from the Pro SABANA program: landless peasants, social unrest, impoverishment, corruption, contaminated water and ecological imbalance due to deforestation.
The Union warns that all this could happen if the project continues as planned.
Wikipedia appears on Shughni
"Good news Pamiris", writes Bektour Iskender, President of Kloop Media, a news portal and blogging platform in Kyrgyzstan.
"Wikipedia has given permission to start a version of the site in shughni".
Shughni is one of the main languages spoken in Gorno Badakhshan Province (GBAO), a remote part of eastern Tajikistan dominated by the Pamir Mountains.
Iskender helped local Internet users submit the request to create a Shughni section of Wikipedia after a new media training session in Khorog, the administrative capital of the province, more than two years ago.
"Now begins the little detail of the realization.
Shughni is one of several dialects of the Pamiri subgroup of languages, a branch of the Farsi language tree, which also includes Tajikistan's state language, Tajik.
Tayiko already has a growing presence on Wikipedia, with 10,864 articles, more than Turkman (4,765), but less than Kazakh and Kyrgyz, (both around 25,000) and far behind Uzbek (120,882).
The non-state languages spoken in post-Soviet Central Asia, such as Uighur, are doing a little less well (2.924), and the Shughni Wikipedia project faces a huge task as well, given that the proportion of the Pamiri community that can still write in the language is very small.
However, the Shughni speakers who try to revive the language in its written form have the hope that, when there is Wikipedia, there will be a way.
Mothers of missing Mexicans are on hunger strike
A group of mothers on hunger strike commemorated Mother's Day outside the office of the Attorney General of the Republic in Mexico City and demanded that the Mexican government fulfill its promise to search for their missing children.
According to official reports, more than 26,000 people have gone missing in Mexico between December 1, 2006, and November 30, 2012, during the administration of former President Felipe Calderón.
Women have been on strike since 9 May 2013.
Erwin C. in the Latin Americanist blog quoted one of the mothers who participated in the hunger strike:
We will not leave until our cases are resolved, the president meets with us and he meets a drinking group to tell us when and how they will start finding our loved ones , declared hunger strike leader Margarita López.
Lopez said her missing daughter, Yahaira Guadalupe Bahena, was kidnapped two years ago by armed men who then tortured her to death.
Lopez has urged authorities to open a mass grave where his daughter is allegedly buried, but his requests have been ignored so far.
Lopez was one of the participants in a seven-day hunger strike that took place last November and ended after Mexico City authorities met with the protesters.
Paris Martinez, of the digital publication Animal Politico, has covered the hunger strike from the beginning.
In a post, she introduced readers to some of the mothers who participated in the strike, such as Nancy Rosete, whose son Elvis Axell Torres Rosete has been missing since December 29, 2010:
I decided to take part in the hunger strike because, as victims, we do not have any certainty about the actions taken by the authorities.
It has been more than two years and, although there are alleged advances in the investigation, we cannot verify them.
On May 13, Martínez reported for Animal Politico that "apart from a brief exchange of comments by deputy prosecutor Ricardo Garcia Cervantes - the day the protest began - no authority has gone to find out about the requests or to start a formal dialogue".
He says they're feeling the effects of lack of food, that the temperature drops at night and they don't feel safe.
Erica adds that people have been helping them.
Another protester says they will not go: "We are not here just for one person, we are here for a common goal, which is to look for the missing":
On Wednesday, May 15, Paris reported that a group representing the protesters will visit Los Pinos - the residence and official office of the President of Mexico - to submit their written requests to President Enrique Peña Nieto, "to explain the lack of concrete actions in the search for our children".
Bahrain jails six tweets for insulting the king
Six Twitter users were sentenced to a year in prison by a Bahrain court on May 15 for alleged insults to King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa on the microblogging site.
He added that the six were "accused of misuse of freedom of expression and opinion publicly and were given a pre-trial prison sentence". According to the Bahrain Press Association, based in London, the sentenced are:

Bolivian workers protest for better pensions
Tensions are rising in Bolivia as miners, teachers, healthcare workers and public university staff - all affiliated with the Bolivian Workers' Centre - are on strike demanding an increase in their retirement program.
Several strategic streets remain blocked in La Paz and the neighboring city of El Alto, with limited public transport circulating along their usual routes.
As the protests intensified, on May 14, teachers and miners detonated dynamite in the streets of La Paz amid demonstrations.

The representatives of the COB demand an increase in their pensions from the current 70 percent to 100 percent of their salary.
They ask that the 30 to 50 per cent increase in their compensation be from public funds saved in the Solidarity Fund.
Public officials rejected this demand as they consider it compromises the sustainability of the "Solidarity Fund".
Negotiations are intermittent as the government asks the COB representatives to suspend the protests and blockades.
In addition, the lower-ranking union police and their wives have threatened to join the general protest to demand better retirement programs, arguing the same conditions as the Navy officers: a retirement with 100 percent of their contributions.
Alters between police and protesters were reported via Twitter under the tag #ConflictsBo.
Despite the conflict, and despite the continuation of the blockades and protests, dialogue between trade unions and government representatives is expected to resume.

Blogger and analyst Raúl Prada comments on his blog Horizontes Nómadas:
On the other hand, the minister of economy Luis Arce stated that the government does contribute with the Fund Solidario and "that guarantees the payment of 70 percent with respect to salaries".
He added that "the government's proposal ensures the sustainability of the Solidarity Fund for about 30 years and that it supports the current and future pensioners financially".
According to the state radio station Patria Nueva, "the authority explained that the representatives of the COB are looking for a 'political decision' instead of a technique to increase pensions, which is not possible as it would risk the income of all retirees".
On his blog, Boris Bernal shares the analysis made by the Centre for Studies for Labour and Agricultural Development (CEDLA):
The outlook for young workers and for all those who have contributed to the current system as well as to the one in place until 2010 (a system administered by AFP) is more critical, because unlike former contributors they will have only one source, their contributions, which will make the amount required to retire even less sufficient.
Jorge Rafael Videla, the ideologist of the Argentine military dictatorship, died
Jorge Rafael Videla, former president of Argentina, died on May 17, 2013 at the age of 87 in the cell where he was a prisoner.
Videla ruled between 1976 and 1981, during the Argentine military dictatorship, a period that sowed death in the country and left thousands missing.
In 1983 the former dictator was tried and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity.
In 2010 Videla was sentenced to life imprisonment for torturing and shooting 31 political prisoners, and in 2012 he was sentenced to another 50 years in prison for kidnapping newborns during the dictatorship.
In an obituary, BBC Mundo writes: "He was one of Argentina's most controversial and hated men, and under his regime some 30,000 people died or disappeared, according to figures from human rights organizations".
Jose Alejandro Godoy on the page From the Third Floor wrote about the events that took place during the years of Videla's rule:
And regarding his death, he concludes:
Today Videla died in a common prison without privileges.
He will be buried in a grave, unlike many of his victims, thrown into the sea from a plane.
Repudiated by Argentine society.
With a historic trial that leads him to the most infamous pages in Latin America.
On the other hand, LSO wrote a brief entry on his blog, where he refers to Videla as a "dignified officer and soldier who fulfilled the mission that imposed his honor".

@Cami_Cotarelo: #MurioVidela is not celebrated, but today after almost 40 years more than 30,000 people rest in peace
Cecilia Saia (@Cecisaia) also expressed the sentiment of many Argentines:
@Cecisaia: There is one less monster in the world today.If there is anything after death, let him return for a thousand everything he did #muriovidela
Adolfo Perez Esquivel (@PrensaPEsquivel), Nobel Peace Prize winner, wrote on his Twitter account:

Yemen: Focus on education!
In a country where the literacy rate for both sexes (15 years and older) is almost 40 percent, education and empowerment of women and youth is a must for any concrete development in Yemen.
Activist and researcher Atiaf Alwazir wrote a post entitled "Reading should be a right and not a privilege" highlighting the importance of education for women.
Atiaf urged:
Let us all work together to demand concrete changes, and to demand that the government reimplement the literacy programme as it did in the past.
We must also make rights to education and health a political priority at the national dialogue conference (which began in March 2013 and is scheduled to end in August 2013).

Activist and chairwoman of the Rights and Freedoms Working Group on National Dialogue, Arwa Othman, highlighted the importance of education, but also added in a post on her Facebook page:
Not only is it the right to education as declared by human rights conventions, but these letters must also be included in the curriculum in the Republic of Yemen (New Yemen) ... and taught as a fundamental subject to promote a culture of human rights, tolerance, coexistence, peace, freedom, citizenship, equality, non-discrimination, freedom of difference, freedom of religion, etc... that is, respect for human beings regardless of their color, sex, religion, language, opinion and political principles... etc. We hope to draw from this National Dialogue Conference a constitutional text that respects the rights of future generations.
VIDEO: Reflective Brazilian boy doesn't want to eat meat
The YouTube video of three-year-old Luiz Antonio explaining to his mother why he doesn't want to eat octopus noodles has become the most recent video worldwide.
The Brazilian boy claims that he does not like eating meat because "when you eat animals, they die", and that he likes to see animals "standing, happy", and explains that we must "take care of them, not eat them".
The original Portuguese video, uploaded to YouTube on May 15, 2013, has already had about 1,500,000 views in just two weeks.
The English version was published on May 29 and within three days had been viewed more than 900,000 times.
In a country where only a very small percentage of the population has opted for a vegetarian diet, the viral video has sparked a heated debate about vegetarianism on YouTube and Facebook.
Carlos Augusto Andrade explained the reasons:
The video went viral on Facebook yesterday, it's one of those that you share with all kinds of people: your mother, your aunt, your sophisticated friends, your school contacts... and while some groups on Facebook and YouTube have used the video to discuss vegetarianism, we understand that it's only gone viral because it is: the cute video of a child who is curiously eloquent for his age and reflects on something that we don't all bother to stop and think about.
Philosophy of Luiz Antonio: "When we eat animals, they die.
I don't like that, I like to see them standing, happy.
We must take care of them, not eat them".
Inspired by the simplicity of the child's argument, some people have decided to adopt a meatless lifestyle, like many of the friends with whom blogger Viviane Zandonadi shared the video.
As a food writer, she wondered what she'd do with her daughter when she started asking these kinds of questions:
I'm really looking forward to it.
When it's my turn, if Cata questions the logic of the food chain, I have no idea what I'm gonna say.
Luiz Antonio has knocked my arguments down.
At the end of the video, Luiz Antonio's mother, moved to tears, asks her son to eat only rice and potatoes.
In the blog Acerto de Contas, Guilherme Carvalho hopes that other parents will start respecting their children's sensitivities, and stop using lies or simplistic arguments to force children to change their minds:
So in 2013, it's time to stop fooling our children and suppressing their feelings of compassion when they don't show a penchant for eating animals.
Let us respect and value this altruistic and compassionate attitude.
Having a vegetarian child is not a problem, and today there is extensive literature showing the potential health benefits of this option.
Luiz Antonio's video has left many people moved - and hopeful.
The Caribbean flu scare originated accidentally in China.
What's in a name with a couple of numbers and letters?
It turns out that a lot, when those letters and numbers refer to a strain of the influenza virus (flu).
While it is not critical to know your hemaglutinin from your neuraminidase (the two proteins at the origin of the conventions for the "H" and "N" flu names), as the National Pork Board states in its guidelines for influenza names (PDF): "Knowing the proper name of a flu virus is important to adjust to the facts and avoid misinterpretation and an inappropriate response".
Specific case: the confusion of the first week of June of avian/swine flu, which had officials from Trinidad and Tobago pointing to Venezuela after (unfounded) concerns about avian flu following a visit by an official delegation headed by Chinese President Xi Jinping, and officials in Haiti who imposed a ban on the import of meat and chicken products from its neighbor, the Dominican Republic.
The likely source of this confusion, according to Canadian novelist and blogger Crawford Kilian, was a poor translation from Chinese to English by Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.
The first clue, detected by Kilian on June 6, 2013 and reported in a blog post titled "H7N9 in the Caribbean? Unlikely", was a report on Trinidad Express that Kilian described as "the least likely story since the outbreak began".
The Express article focused on a "suspicious" case of avian influenza in Trinidad and Tobago, and reported that "questions were beginning to arise" about the reasons why members of the 153-person delegation that accompanied Chinese President Xi Jinping on an official visit to Trinidad in the first week of June were not screened for avian influenza upon entry into the country, given that "China is currently fighting an avian influenza pandemic .
The article quoted Trinidad and Tobago's Health Minister as saying that although there was no "outbreak" of avian influenza in the country, certainly Trinidad and Tobago was susceptible due to its proximity to Venezuela.
"The idea that important members of the Chinese government are carrying H7N9 is simply absurd, unless we assume that President Xi and his colleagues also have additional income as chicken traders.
China is not "fighting a bird flu pandemic".
The reported Chinese deaths and case numbers don't make sense.
And no matter what the bunch of cases they have in Venezuela, they're not H7N9 or H5N1".
On the same day, Kilian reported finding the likely source of the bad information: an article by China's official news agency, Xinhua, titled "A bird flu virus infects 724 people in Venezuela".
The Haiti Observer blog, from Florida, had a similar error in a June 7 post about the Haitian government's ban on importing chicken and other meat products from its neighboring Dominican Republic, where, according to the article, a warning has been issued "concerning the bird flu outbreak (H1N1 virus)  (the highlight is ours).
The error was reproduced in the French-language Haitian newspaper Le Nouvelliste.
The Dominican Republic exports 25 million eggs and eight million chickens to Haiti each year.
Although there was certainly an outbreak of the H2N2 strain of avian influenza in the Dominican Republic in 2008, Dominican officials have been adamant that the country is currently free of avian influenza, and claim that the five flu deaths have been due to swine flu, which has no impact on the quality of local meat exports.

Peru celebrates the Feast of the Sun
More than 64,000 people celebrated Inti Raymi, the Feast of the Sun, at the Sacshayhuamán archaeological park, about 15 minutes from Cusco city.
The staging of Inti Raymi began in the temple of Coricancha with the greeting to the Sun and then developed in the Plaza Mayor.
It ended in Sacsayhuamán with the ceremony proper.
The Inca, escorted by his coyote and a crew of more than 200 people, entered around 2 p.m. on a raised platform in the middle of the park, after a tour of the stone fortifications.
Several ceremonies were held such as the rite of chicha de jora, fire and sanku, the main food of the Andean man.

June 24 is the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, the shortest day and the longest night of the year.
During the time of the Incas, it was the starting point of the new year and according to the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, writer and historian of the 17th century, it was the main festival of the year.
However, in today's Cusco, the date is more of a show aimed at both tourists and the Cusqueños themselves, for whom it is a reference point of their local consciousness and that conveys enthusiasm and mass participation.
The website Toustodo's Blog explains with reference to the solstice:
Astronomically, the solstice is the time when the Sun reaches the maximum northern (23° 27°) or southern (-23° 27°) declination relative to the Earth's equator.
In the Northern Hemisphere the Sun reaches its zenith at the winter solstice at noon over the Tropic of Capricorn, occurring on June 20 or 21.
In the Southern Hemisphere, the Sun reaches its zenith at noon over the Tropic of Cancer on June 21 or 22.
Solstices are caused by the tilt of the Earth's axis over the plane of its orbit.
The Alternative Media blog tells a bit of the story of Inti Raymi:
Since the Spanish conquest, the ceremony was suppressed by the Catholic Church and the Andean society that celebrated the festival of the sun was dismembered.
The Inti Raymi was then forgotten, until the middle of the 20th century when, as an expression of a great movement of revaluation of native culture in Peru, it was brought back to the scene.
The Inti Raymi in the time of the Incas was a religious ceremony, now it is a theatrical performance, however this expression generates a sense of identity in the people.
The version is expressed in the original language, Quechua, with its corresponding translation into Spanish to facilitate a better understanding.
On Twitter there were also comments about the Sun Festival, such as Kristell PerezAlbela (@Kristellpa):
@SanBlasSpanish: Yesterday was the Inti Raymi, I hope you all enjoyed it!
@Vientino: Since dawn yesterday the festival of the sun, Inti Raymi, was celebrated in the steppes and serranes of the Andes.
Anyel (@AnyelZae) referred to the preferences of some parents when choosing names for their children:
@AnyelZae: Putsch times parents are stressed when choosing names for their children #intiraymi x ejemplo..
@lopezraulh: Yesterday at work we celebrated Inti Raymi.
That's what we call individuals.
Finally, ronaldchamat (@ronaldchamat) shared the excitement of having lived the experience of Inti Raymi:
@ronaldchamat: 5 years ago I was present at #IntiRaymi, what a privilege to have been there at that exact moment http://elcomercio.pe/actualidad/159 ...
FOTOS: Police violence against protesters and bystanders in Rio de Janeiro
This publication is part of our special coverage of the Vinegar Revolt in Brazil.
A week ago, on the afternoon of June 20, 2013, Brazil was rocked by the largest wave of protest in its recent history.
In Rio de Janeiro, an event that began as a peaceful demonstration from the city center to the city hall spread to other neighborhoods and ended in violent clashes between police and protesters.
According to official estimates, about 300,000 people took part in the demonstration in Rio de Janeiro.
Among them is the Brazilian photographer Calé who recorded in a photo reportage the indiscriminate use of rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas by the police against unarmed protesters.
The result is the testimonial and photos below, carefully selected by Calé for Global Voices Online:
At the beginning of the demonstration people danced and celebrated on the way to the town hall, there was joy.

The leaders of the demonstration made a human chain in front of the police to avoid conflicts, to ensure that a small group of agitators did not spoil an afternoon of such pleasant demonstrations.

The protesters managed to keep the protest peaceful in front of the town hall, until a 29-year-old bodybuilder, Gabriel Campos, who is now wanted by the police, began insulting the police who were on their horses, despite people asking him to get away from there.
At one point, protesters asked the police to stop him before it was too late.
The protesters used wooden panels as a shield and threw stones at the police.
Photo: Calé, authorized release.
The protesters, who did not react, tried to take justice into their own hands, and a fight broke out.
It was the excuse the police were hoping for.
At the first sign of conflict, tear gas and rubber bullets were thrown at the crowd.
Panic as people flee from the police Photo: Calé, authorized publication.
At no point was there any intention of invading the city hall, people have simply become furious and started to counterattack the police with stones and sticks.
What happened next was the biggest police abuse case of the decade: Special strike troops evacuated the streets of downtown Rio from the bohemian neighborhood of La Lapa, which is 2.5 km away.
In response, many shops and buildings were looted and robbed on President Vargas Avenue.

Even after the conflict ended, police continued to throw tear gas at peaceful protesters returning home, far from the city hall.
There was no distinction between the agitators and the peaceful people trying to return home.
Since the subway was closed, people had to walk out of the conflict zone.

Since the subway stations were closed, everyone had to walk out of the conflict zone.
At the Carioca station a group was waiting for the doors to open, when the police passed through the Avenida Rio Branco.This station is located on a pedestrian street, perpendicular to the avenue, and when the police were already moving away, someone shouted "Cowards, sons of p... " and they then immediately turned around and threw gas at the people.
On Rio Branco Avenue, police are evacuating the street.

Soon, the subway workers opened a small door for people to enter, but they ended up creating a trap where people got trapped in a funnel, inhaling gas.
Below many were nauseous and lying on the floor.

Many decided to leave the demonstration at the first sign of conflict, and went to the Lapa neighborhood to get a beer, a place they felt far away and safe.
But soon the police arrived and people got stuck in bars and restaurants as chaos swept the streets.
While people started insulting them, the police were also throwing tear gas at buildings irresponsibly.

Yes, there were vandals in the demonstration, who broke and burned things, but most of these acts happened in President Vargas, near the city hall.
In meetings and on social media people are now talking about their fear of going out into the streets to protest and some want the protests to end.
Only one term comes to mind to explain the behavior of our police: state terrorism.

China orders older children to visit their parents
China has enacted a new law this week that requires older children to visit their parents often.
In China, it is a firm tradition to respect the elderly and to care for parents when they get older, but modern lifestyles have led young people to leave their homes to pursue their careers and their mate.
The new law says adults should care for their parents' spiritual needs and that they should never neglect the elderly, but it does not specify how often they should visit their parents or what punishment they will receive if they do not.
The law is passed at a time when China's population is rapidly aging because of the one-child policy.
The journal reported that more than 14 percent of China's population, or 194 million people, are over the age of 60, according to the latest National Bureau of Statistics studies.
In addition, since 2012, China's pension system has been in crisis, with a deficit of $2.9 trillion.
Young Chinese people fear they will end up having to support government pensioners.
The new law has sparked mockery on China's most popular microblogging website, Sina Weibo, where many people joked that enforcing the law is questionable, and visiting parents should be a moral issue that should be encouraged, not demanded by law.
Some users complained that they didn't have enough free time to visit their parents even if they wanted to, while others thought the law was made to compensate for the Chinese pension problem.
The Internet personality  Zhuomo Xiansheng  wrote sarcastically:
Image from Sina Weibo
Family ties must be based on spontaneous emotions.
It's funny that the law turns them into you: it's like demanding that couples have a good sex life after marriage.
Lawyer Yang Lei subscribed to this sentiment:
The question is how to enforce the law.
For example, will parents be given a fingerprinting machine?
Social security is mainly for civil servants, most ordinary people do not have a pension to cover.
TV host Cao Baoying thinks the law is a way for the government to evade its own responsibility:
By passing this law, it emphasizes unilateral civic duty, while lightening the responsibilities of the government.
An article in ifeng news concludes:
Passing a law that promotes filial piety can be effective if children are to be forced to visit their parents, but if external pressure is not reduced, what sense does this filial piety have?
Chile Movilized: 'Mapping' the student movement
This post, written by Elisa Moreno Gili, is the second part of a series on the Chilean student revolts.
The original post, "The revolts of Chilean students: Chile mobilized (part 2) " was published in Ciudadano Periodismo.
As we have already mentioned in the first article on student movements in Chile and in the Movilized Chile, the creation of digital media in this region is already a deeply rooted practice.
In September 2005, citizen journalists from Chile, Peru and Mexico, among others, began to awaken in the Chilean population a desire to communicate beyond traditional media.
Inspired by the South Korean media OhMyNews and driven by former senator Fernando Flores and the Atina Chile movement, they created El Morrocotudo.
This newspaper, which is still in operation today, has had a major impact on the creation of other local citizen media less influenced by the senator's initial figure, such as Maulee.
The perception of whistleblowers in Chile about information management largely reflects the assimilation of citizen journalism among the population.
The use of traditional media by Chile Movilizado is considered a positive impact that should reinforce the work that the collaborators are doing.
Chile Movilizado is a medium that emerges following student protests in Chile over reform of the General Education Law.
From left to right, Juan Jose Peters, Pablo Loyola and Aníbal Vivaceta, creators of Chile Movilized
The protests, which education minister Carolina Scmidt calls illegitimate, have caused more than one student to be wounded by the carabiners.
Pablo Loyola says that the information the carabinero has about security in Chile is very high.
That is, the uninformed are the citizens themselves.
This is why it is important to create citizen media such as Chile Movilizado, which allows the population to access current information at local level.
That social movements on the web are a key factor in Chilean elections is no secret.
Members of the political elite such as presidential candidate Marcel Claude use social media to spread their message, in this case in favor of student movements via Twitter.
Marcel Claude's lecture given at the Universidad del Mar was published in Chile Movilizado as an event of mobilization.
Chile Movilizado aims to achieve full coverage of student protests in the future.
His wish is to embrace both the daily updated information and related future and past events so that he can make a guide for the protesters.
We want this year to make visible everything that happened in the student movement and for that we need to review everything that happened during the year and everything that will happen.
Saudi Arabia: Women banned from attending public trials
This post is part of our special coverage: Reformists on trial in Saudi Arabia
Saudi judges continue to ban women from attending public trials, even when they are close relatives.
Yesterday, the second session of the trial of Umar Al-Saeed, a member of the country's leading human rights organization, the Saudi Association of Political and Civil Rights (ACPRA), was held in the Saudi city of Buraida.
The session was supposed to be held last Thursday, but was postponed without notice after several activists had traveled to attend.
Al-Saeed, 23, was arrested on April 28 after refusing to be questioned without a lawyer present.
There are currently seven ACPRA members in custody.
At yesterday's session, Al-Saeed responded to the charges and accused the interrogator of mistreatment:
I was interrogated with the wives on.
The interrogator refused to take them away.
They were tight and they hurt me.
The interrogator was also provocative, insulting me, "you're a piece of shit, you're a criminal" and other things I'm not willing to repeat.
Some of those who attended today's session via alajmi01
In addition, Al-Saeed, a university student who was about to graduate when he was arrested, said the interrogator bribed him:
Interrogator Ahmed al-Thukri bribed me: he threatened to deny me my final exams if I did not confess what he wanted.
In a previous trial, another judge said "men are enough", which led to another ACPRA member, Abdulkareem al-Khadar, refusing to attend the trial and being arrested.

China: Jaingmen residents protest a uranium plant
On July 12, 2012, hundreds of residents of Jiangmen, a city near southern Guangzhou, took to the streets to protest a planned uranium processing plant.
Those marching through the city were carrying posters and masks that said, "We want children who are not atoms".
The protesters said they were concerned about radiation and possible nuclear pollution.
According to the New York Times, Jiangmen authorities have already signed an agreement with China's National Nuclear Corporation to host the six-billion-dollar project.
The local government announced the project a few weeks ago giving the public 10 days to comment.
After the demonstration a press conference was held and the mayor pledged to extend the deadline for the public to comment by 10 days.
Earlier this year, a similar demonstration took place in Kumming, southern China, where residents protested a gas refinery.
The 'South China Morning Post' reported that the demonstrations have been organized via messages on Chinese social networks: QQ and WeChat.
On China's most popular microblogging site, Sina Weibo, information about the protests was quickly censored.
Some Weibo users managed to access the censored post and photos.
Below are some photos of the demonstrations via Sina Weibo:
The signs say, "We want children not atoms".
Pakistani Taliban militant writes open letter to Malala
After teenage activist Malala Yousafzai's speech at the UN calling for free education for all children, Adnan Rasheed, a militant of Pakistan's Tehreek-e-Taliban, wrote a letter to the Pakistani urging her to return home and seek education at a local madrasa.
In his letter, Rasheed says he would like Malala never to have been attacked and argues that the Taliban shot him in the head because it is a propaganda tool used to defame the group, and not because she wants to receive an education.
His letter went from Tehreek-e-Taliban's Pakistan media to journalists and was published in its entirety by Newsweek Pakistan.
Here's an excerpt from it:
I hope that the compassion you learned from the Prophet Jesus will be taught by the United States and NATO so that they can stop the bloodshed of innocent Muslims around the world and I would like the same for the followers of Buddha to stop the killing of innocent Muslims unarmed in Burma and Sri Lanka and I wish the Indian army to follow Gandhi and stop the genocide in Kashmir.
In the end, I advise you to go home, adopt Islamic and Pashtun culture, enroll in some female Islamic madrasa near your home, study and learn the Book of Allah, use your pen for Islam and the hardships of the Muslim ummah and expose the conspiracy of the small elite who want to enslave all mankind by their wickedness in the name of the new world order.
Rasheed tells Malala that he feels compelled to write to her because they belong to the same Pashtun tribe: "All my emotions are fraternal to you because we belong to the same Yousafzai tribe".
He is a former member of the Pakistan Air Force.

Pavel Durov, the founder of the Russian social network, will not go to jail...
It seems Pavel Durov can finally return to Russia without the threat of a prison sentence.
This, at least for now, seems to be true, now that the St. Petersburg detectives have closed their investigation into Durov's alleged involvement in the April 5, 2013, traffic accident that caused a police officer minor injuries.
Although it was finally determined that Durov was driving the vehicle, investigators announced today that they have not been able to find evidence to show that he had acted lightly.
Durov ("the Russian Zuckerberg" and creator of the country's most famous social network, Vkontakte) has been living outside Russia since the car accident, probably to avoid calls for questioning from investigators.
What caused this radical change in the researchers' view?
Did any senior government representative intervene to "calm the waters"?
Or has Durov been planning something and the end of his criminal case meant that he has reached an agreement with the Kremlin authorities, who have recently shown more and more willingness to exercise control over Vkontakte?
Durov denied the rumor and insisted he had not been expatriated.
Without the threat of prison, it's now Durov who has to come back and prove he hasn't left Russia forever.

The Open Labs Community in Albania
This post, by Maria Grabowski, was originally published by the engine room.
This is the second in a series of posts to profile the resources offered in the Social Tech Census.
The Social Tech Census from The Engine Room is an online database, as support for advocates around the world who seek to make better use of digital media and mobile phones.
The Social Tech Census identifies a variety of resources for the use of technology in defense work.

Open Labs started the way a lot of projects do -- a group of people in a bar came up with an idea. The group of founders agreed that knowledge sharing, open collaboration, open data and open source software are the foundation of a healthy society.
Through hard work and teamwork the idea became an established organization - and in mid-July Open Labs celebrated its 1st anniversary.
A non-governmental non-profit organization based in Albania, it is both a hacker lab and a community that is working towards a central goal: sharing knowledge through open technology.
Open Labs hosts weekly events to promote various tools through online technology, meetings, presentations, training and workshops.
A small group of key volunteers pushed the project forward, 45 members regularly participate, and several hundred have attended the Open Labs events.
Historically, good quality of life has always been connected with access to knowledge", said co-founder Redon Skikuli speaking to us from his headquarters in Tirania, Albania.
When Redon came into contact with the free software and culture movement, he quickly saw the potential of using technology as an open channel for open knowledge. "I love technology and I thought that getting into open source technology was a way to not only use technology, but use the right technology for solutions".
However, offline meetings remain crucial, and Redon describes Open Labs as "coffee-oriented": "Here personal conversation is much more effective than any other form of communication.
You do business and you create communities in the cafes".
Six patches of engine room
1. the following:
How do I find Open Labs?
We have different types of channels: the newsletter, the website and our mailing list.
Our experience, however, is that word of mouth is the most important way for people to learn about us.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
How do I get involved with Open Labs?
The first thing to do is to attend our events or participate in workshops and projects.
For example, Open Labs translates and projects TED Talks.
We also have nightly movies with creative commons movies -- for example, we show the documentary The Pirate Bay.
Once a month we also open up space for interesting projects that aren't an Open Labs project.
So if you have an idea for an event related to knowledge opening or knowledge sharing, let us know a week in advance and we'll arrange it.
Our online communication is a wall of ideas, and on the ground we do things.
3. the number of days.
What kind of resources do they offer?
We have weekly events and workshops in our space in Tirana.
For example, you can learn how to use Linux, WordPress or learn about open standards and open data.
4th
What are your biggest challenges?
The funding!
The challenge is not finding funding, the problem is that you quickly end up spending all your time looking for money, instead of actually doing projects.
We are aware that we have grown organically, and our top priority is building a community that is free and fluid - but another challenge is to survive the vision: Bring more people on board and make a movement in Albania.
5th.
What possibilities do you see in using technology to support and mobilize civil society?
Smartphones have given us more computing power and quality cameras than we could have imagined.
This has already happened during the uprisings in some countries.
It is also important to know that these devices can also be used by non-democratic governments to track our activities.
That's why the software for these mobile devices has to be free software - free as free software not free as free beer.
6.
How can the Social Tech Census be useful in your work?
Collaboration and knowledge sharing with other communities internationally is the fun part of our work.
This means that every time someone communicates with us and proposes a new project or collaboration, we are more than happy that we will get our hands dirty.
Each platform/project with the aim of bringing these initiatives together will help the doer scene share more innovations and is more than welcome for me personally and for Open Labs as a collective.

Elysium and immigration to the United States. Reality or fiction?
Elysium, the film set in the year 2155 starring Matt Damon and Jodie Foster, stabs the health care system in the United States, and also offers a glimpse into the country's immigration system if comprehensive reform is carried out.
The film, directed by Neill Blomkamp, takes place on a space station equipped with the latest technological advances called Elysium on a overpopulated and devastated planet Earth.
Matt Damon is the lead in "Elysium".
Elysium focuses his attention on an ex-con named Max (Damon), whose deplorable health condition forces him to seek the services of a criminal political leader who also wants to seize Elysium's exceptional health resources in order to find a cure for the sick inhabitants of Earth.
However, both will face the dishonest Delacourt, the Elysium Defense Secretary (Foster), who relentlessly at all costs prevents the inhabitants (or "illegal", as the film defines them) from entering Elysium.
Early in the film, Delacourt orders a ruthless downing of a spacecraft full of immigrants in an attempt to enter Elysium.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific measure to prevent the entry of illegal immigrants into the Union.
Just as Elysium is unraveling, one might think that the main reason these "illegal" want to flee planet Earth for a more comfortable life in Elysium is parallel to the reason why many immigrants decide to cross the border and find a better life in the United States (of course, the U.S. is the Elysium for all hopeful immigrants abroad).
The film also shows that immigrants go to Elysium to find a better healthcare system, but they need to be citizens of Elysium to benefit from it.
In real life, many undocumented immigrants face the same problem, given that they do not have access to health care.
Before we get into the weeds of immigration debate, blogs like ThinkProgress explain that Elysium is short on why the healthcare system on the space satellite is better than the Earth:
But the more you think about it, the more you convince yourself that Elysium is not able to tell the truth, that it's not really like it's the way things are because it's not able to answer a simple question: why is there so little Earth health care in Elysium's world?
The film shows us many ways in which life on Elysium is more comfortable and satisfying than on Earth, but Blomkamp focuses almost exclusively on inhabitants of planet Earth who aspire to reach Elysium primarily to access medical equipment capable of curing them, even from serious illnesses, with a simple and quick scan".
ThinkProgress goes on to say:
And at the end of the movie, they get it.
Spider and Max download a program on Elysium's central computer that turns everyone on Earth into citizens of Elysium and thus enables them to be scanned by devices, launchers full of these equipment are sent to Earth, where people of all races, sexes and religions can use them.
The problem does not seem to be the shortage of medical equipment.
There might be other reasons for this restriction in health care, but whatever the reasons may be are not clear in the film".
Applying this last paragraph to real life can mean that legalizing the immigration situation of 11 million people in the United States will ensure a better quality of life for all of them.
As the Immigration Policy Center notes:
Granting health care to legal immigrants not only strengthens the system but is a crucial part of their integration into American society.
In addition to working, paying taxes and learning English, immigrants must be able to pay their contribution and receive affordable health care, like everyone else".
When asked if the film shows what human conditions will be like in 140 years, Blomkamp replied:
No, no, no, I'm not going to.
This is not science fiction.
This is now".
As for immigration, Blomkamp might be right.
Elysium portrays the United States as a country that has been overtaken by Latin Americans and whose native language of iure is Spanish, at a time when the badges of local offices and factories contain writing in Spanish, and where law enforcement is referred to as "Police".
Finally, there is one thing we can deduce from the film and that is that no society, however perfect it claims to be, can turn a blind eye to its inhabitants and their needs - and addressing the issue of immigration is the first step toward understanding human history.

FOTOS: Flooding in the capital of the Philippines
Tropical storm Maring (internationally known as Trami) caused flooding in the Metro Manila area and neighboring provinces of the Philippines leaving a balance of 8 dead, 41 injured and 4 missing.
According to a government report, 125,348 families (602,442 people) were affected by the storm.
As of the evening of 20 August, 40,837 people remain as refugees in 198 evacuation centres.
The flood damaged 65 main roads that were left untransitable.
A total of 162 flights (59 international and 103 domestic) were cancelled due to the storm.
The Filipinos used the #marigngPH and #floodPH tags to monitor all flood events in Manila and nearby regions.
Below are some photos posted on Facebook and Twitter showing the magnitude of the flood disaster.

Four hundred Cuban doctors arrive in Brazil
David Oliveira de Souza, a doctor and professor at the Institute of Research at the Hospital Sirio-Libanés, sent an open letter to the more than 400 Cuban doctors who recently arrived in Brazil and who constitute the first group of a total of 4,000 galens who will be arriving in this country before December of this year.

The letter, published by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, states:
You will be compensated, in large part, for the warm welcome in the communities you will be caring for from now on.
According to Oliveira de Souza, in states like Sergipe it is easy to move from the capital to the Interior, but still there are hundreds of vacant jobs, even in well-equipped and in good condition health units.
With the South American nation running a deficit of 14,500 gallons, Dilma Rousseff's government approved the "Master Doctors" program, which will hire doctors from Spain, Portugal and Cuba, among other nations.
Recently, one of the main criticisms of the hiring of Cubans is that they were "being exploited".
In the face of this argument, Oliveira de Souza states in her letter:
On behalf of our people and most of our doctors, I can only say with conviction: a fraternal hug and many thanks.
'Million People's March' Against Corruption in the Philippines
Mass protests, the largest since President Benigno 'Noynoy' Aquino III took office three years ago, shook the Philippines, on National Heroes Day, August 26, when hundreds of thousands expressed outrage at government corruption and called for a total abolition of money donation to political candidates.
Police estimated that between 80,000 and 100,000 people gathered at Rizal Park in the country's capital, Manila, while thousands more carried out mass actions in other cities nationwide.
Public outrage over such corrupt donations came after the disclosure of the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF), which is allocated to legislators in Congress and the Senate to use in their favorite projects.
For a long time, the PDAF has been the target of criticism as an official corruption site.
But public outcry increased after a whistleblower identified businesswoman Janet Lim-Napoles, who is alleged to have conspired with lawmakers to pocket 10 billion Filipino pesos (about $22 million) through the fund.

From @muntingprinsipe
Called the "Million People's March", the idea behind Monday's 26th meeting at Rizal Park, where middle-class people predominated, originated from social media interactions between concerned netizens on Facebook and Twitter.
The concept for a million-person march against donating money to political candidates began with a Facebook post by music producer Ito Rapadas:
What we need is a MARCH OF A MILLION PERSON by Filipino taxpayer-fighting, a day of silent majority protest that would demand that all politicians and government officials (whatever political bands or colors they have) stop pocketing our money from our hard work through these corruption traps and other creative criminal acts.
This was shared by several webmasters, including his friend Peachy Brittany, who suggested that the mass action be held on August 26, National Heroes Day.
Protests were also held in various cities nationwide, notably in Bacolod City, Baguio City, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Dagupan City, Davao City, Digos City, Dumaguete City, Iloilo City, Naga City and Puerto Princessa in Palawan.

The protest action stood still.
During the day of the protest, President Aquino and his spokesmen announced that the government was on the same side as the protesters.
Here are some reactions on Twitter:
You don't decide where we want our money to go.
We are.
We want our money for national development, social service and security.
Abolishing pigs.
If Noynoy and the protesters are on the same side, why did people still go to the streets after his press conference?
Abolish vs. change your name.
Pixel Offensive said that if the president is truly on the people's side against paying this fund, he should speak out on the following:
1) Abolition of all this fund, without exception.
Kulangot lang it is kumpara sa PORK nya.
2) Your staff would not tweet anything against the demonstrations.
This only exposes the way of thinking of the inner circle of the presidency.
Let's raise this discussion a little bit, shall we?
Do you expect a farmer president to serve the people?
Critics argue that this presidential corruption  consisting of single-payment allocations, whose disbursement remains solely at the discretion of the president and his executive department worth more than 1.3 billion pesos.
Hours before the anti-corruption rally, presidential spokeswoman Abigail Valte tweeted a link to an article describing outrage over this payment to campaign politicians as a "pleasant but out of place statement".
Are we thinking about the next step, like Juan Tamad, are we waiting for someone to solve our problem?
Anger is the road to the dark side, and that's why hypocrisy and outrage must stop, and the reason why we must change the pace and solve the problem of how the government spends our money.
Another presidential spokesman, Edwin Lacierda, also tweeted a link to the same article and joked "who says blogging is out of fashion!"
For his part, the undersecretary of Comunicaciones, Manuel Quezon III, asked the Catholic Church, which urged the people to attend the mass action, why it remained silent during the mandate of former president Gloria Arroyo.
The aforementioned officials have denied tweeting against the demonstration.
But in the end, no amount of public relations can suppress public outrage over the massive looting of people's money by government officials and their comrades, while millions of Filipinos suffer from hunger, unemployment and extreme poverty.
Mexico: "Reform that has nothing in education"
Teachers in the National Coordinator of Education (CNTE) have protested numerous times since August 17 against the educational reform promoted by President Enrique Peña Nieto that includes, among other controversial points, teacher evaluation.
Many have used social media to show their dislike for the blockades, but now it is teachers who have decided to explain their demands through this medium hoping that the public will see beyond the chaos that the marches cause and support their cause.
This is the case of this rural teacher from Oaxaca, who eloquently explains why he left his family and work behind to protest what he considers a "supposed educational reform, which has nothing educational".
They suggest Obama return the Guantanamo naval base to Cuba
Former U.S. Representative in Cuba Michael Parmly suggested that President Barack Obama return the Guantanamo military base to the island's authorities, among other recommendations cited in a 26-page report that Reuters news agency had access to and will be published shortly at the Fletcher Forum of World Affairs.

Negotiating an agreement with Cuban President Raúl Castro on the naval base could help establish a direct relationship with the Cuban government and citizens, Parmly, who was head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana from 2005 to 2008, said.
Most of the prisoners at Guantanamo could be transferred to prisons in the United States, while the most troubling cases would remain on the island, Parmly notes.
According to the former official, the naval base is a "historical anomaly":

More than 90 people died a few weeks ago when a passenger ship sank off the coast of Cebu province, Philippines, after colliding with a freighter.
However, the impact of the collision is still visible after 120,000 litres of crude from the sunken ship were spilled on the shores of the coastal municipalities of Talisai, Cordoba and Lapulapu.
In addition to affecting more than 300 hectares of mangroves, the oil spill has also displaced more than 3 000 fishermen and threatened to undermine the tourism industry in the area.
Lizzy Oi has visited a fishing village in Cordoba and shared her testimony:
This is how Cordoba has awakened after the oil spill ruined the main livelihood of thousands of fishermen in the municipality.
80% of the population depends mainly on fishing for their daily needs.
Now that everything has faded away with the devastating human-caused tragedy, people seem to be losing hope knowing that the problem will linger for many months and even years.
Cordoba, Cebu.

Oil spill has also reached Mactan beaches.

Meylou has also shown his support for those affected:
It's a real tragedy.
My condolences to the families who have lost loved ones.
I'm sorry for the barangay that have been affected, for the fishermen who can't go out to work and for the dead mangroves.
It will take many years to recover them, but cleaning will have to be carried out diligently or more mangroves will perish:-(.
Sadaba: The oil spill in Cebu has occurred during the high season of mangrove fruit.
The population immediately began cleaning up.
Tishiana Mann observed certain ingenious ways of removing crude oil from water:
Many people have invented interesting ways to help contain oil spills: for example, local hair salons have sent human hair and coconut distribution center business owners have sent lots of coconut shells to act as absorbers.
They even thought of using sawdust to absorb the oil, but when they threw it into the water, the wind blew it away.
Donations and free haircuts were started to help with the cleanup race, and even the concerned population picked up chicken feathers.
Among other relevant news, I wanted to cut my hair and donate it to the Cebu oil spill last weekend.
They punched me.
He's proactive now.
Shopping centres are also encouraged to donate stockings to be used in hair containers to contain oil spills in Cebu.
The loss of life by disasters at sea is staggering.
The consequences of the damage to the marine environment are enormous.
If people continue to endanger their bodies and lives when they board and navigate our waters, it is clear that the need for stricter maritime regulation and maritime transport management is not only imminent but also absolute.
No Liberian student gets into college
This year, as Liberia commemorates the tenth anniversary of the Accra General Peace Agreement that ended a 14-year civil war, nearly 25,000 high school graduates failed the entrance exam to the University of Liberia.
It was the first time that no candidate had ever been approved and admitted.
Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Nobel Peace Prize winner, admits that the education system in Liberia is "a mess".
Public domain photo from the US State Department.
The BBC reported that Education Minister Etmonia David-Tarpeh found it extremely difficult to believe that no candidate would pass, so she is expected to meet with university authorities to discuss the matter.
She describes this failure rate as "mass murder".
However, private adviser James Dabor Jallah, hired by the university to deal with admission exams, confirmed the news and added that the days when students were admitted to the University of Liberia through bribes or connections were over.
Through Twitter, the world has already expressed disbelief in the news.
This is what Professor Calestous Juma (@calestous) of the Harvard Kennedy School and originally from Kenya said:

Leopold II, king of the Belgians, was the de facto sole owner of the Congo Free State from 1885 to 1908, now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Saran Kaba Jones (@sarankjones), a water rights advocate and social entrepreneur, said it was sad but not surprising:

"Central Asia is also looking [at Syria]"
As the United States and Russia discuss the path ahead in Syria, Central Asian governments are closely following the situation, Nathan Barrick writes on Registan.net:
Russia chooses to focus on the prospect that the Syrian government is waging a battle against Islamic extremists and this message probably resonates in Central Asian governments.
Central Asia's official silence on Syria should not hide real sympathy with Russia's perspective... Central Asia is also watching... not because it tries to develop and acquire chemical weapons to use against its population, but because it highlights the security they can deposit in a security partnership with the United States, or it could even reconsider and partner more closely with Russia".
Egypt's #SpyDuck ended up being dinner
A stork - like Menes.

A stork accused of being a duck and spying, and arrested in Egypt, has ended up being part of the food of an Egyptian family.
On August 31, news broke that Egypt had arrested a spy duck, with a suspicious apparatus suspended in its feathers.
Later, it turned out that the duck was a stork, called Menes, and the tracking device was for a study.
On September 4, Mostafa Hussein announced that "the mistakenly accused stork is free":
The mistakenly accused stork is free.
The euphoria was short-lived.
Blogger Zeinobia reported:
After being accused of espionage and spending a day in custody in Egypt, she was released alone to meet her destiny!
It was hunted and eaten by a cloudy family in southern Egypt!
On Facebook, the Egyptian Society for the Conservation of Nature added:
After being released from the Salugah and Ghazal protected areas several days ago, Menes flew to a nearby Nile island, where she was captured and killed to be eaten later.
The post explains:
And the problem is bigger - and more complicated:
Egypt has long suffered from uncontrolled hunting problems.
Although, it is always important to balance the needs of local communities with the conservation of nature and biodiversity.
The post concludes:
The whole region has a long way to go, especially to raise awareness among the population not to hunt migratory birds.
The first six months of Nicolás Maduro as president of Venezuela

FOTOS: Philippines typhoon survivors desperate for food, water and help
A street in Balangiga, Samar, one of the most affected provinces.
Photo by Mr. Abellar Amano, from Autonomo, Facebook.
Aid is not being adequately and quickly distributed to the communities that survived the Haiyan (Yolanda) super typhoon in the Philippines.
Many survivors are complaining that the government's aid packages have not yet reached them.
Haiyan lashed the Visayas Islands on Friday, November 8, and triggered a wave that killed more than 1,500 people.
But the victims could be larger as the situation in remote coastal villages has not been revealed.
Because of the damaged roads, rescuers and support groups were unable to access these communities.
Desperate for food, some survivors plundered supermarkets and rice storage facilities.
Looting was reported in Tacloban City and several cities in Leyte province.
In response, the government promised to speed up the distribution of aid items as it deploys more police forces to restore order in the typhoon-affected communities.
Meanwhile, the panic of shopping in Samar follows:
Anxiety is rampant in Calbayog de Samar, as supplies are running low; panic is seen when shopping in most grocery stores.
When they steal TVs and washing machines, that's looting.
It's really sad that it's come to a point where victims are looting shops and ATMs:
Looters dump items from a warehouse in Guiuan, East Samar, after rescuers struggled to get help to the survivors.
Through Randy Felix Malayao's Facebook page, a survivor asks the public not to be harsh in judging the looters:
Don't be so quick to judge the looters, I was a looters.
I took medicine for the Red Cross, milk and food for the children.
I walked four hours and dug two feet [six meters] of empty plastic bottles to get at least something to drink and bring home something.
The people who took flat-screen TVs were the same people who offered me a drink and some lugaw (rice beans).
Those who seemed to be ex-convicts offered me something to eat.
Almost all the time they're willing to lend a hand when you say you really need something.
What they didn't show on the news is how people helped each other in the midst of the catastrophe.
Don't call them looters, writes Martha Villarosa:
The looters?!
No one has the right to call them that name.
Just imagine how painful it is, for many of them lost their homes, their loved ones died, there is nothing to eat or drink.
Just thank them because we're alive, safe and we're still enjoying our lives.
Let's be positive about this.
All our compatriots need our support and prayers to help them overcome this.
Many roads were damaged by Typhoon Haiyan.

The country's top education official, Brother Armin Luistro, sends this message to educators:
Let's take care of the people first.
Don't worry about property damage. We'll see about that later.
The worst part is counting down buildings and fallen trees and not counting people.
Second, let's get our kids back to school.
The best way for kids to recover is to get them back to their routine as soon as possible  and that is to get them back to school.
There's no need to do classes right away.
Let's play.
Have them have activities.
Atom Araullo reports that communication signals have been partially restored in Tacloban:
Telecommunications services are slowly being restored.
The devastation is overwhelming.
The people here need all the help they can get.
More and more Filipinos are participating in the rescue operations:
It is so moving to see so many people working hard at the top of the relief operations.
At times like this, I thank you for social media.
Guiuan, east of Samar.
This is a public school and an evacuation center.
That's all that's left now.
Palo, the campus of the University of the Philippines in Leyte, was damaged by the storm.
That's all that's left now.
Do you know what resilience really means?
It would be a month or two from now when everyone is gone, all the free food stops coming, people are back on their own and realizing what happened and what's left in store will hit them like a whirlwind with all its might.
Then people will know what resilience really means.
Tunisian rap song becomes an anthem for youth
On September 14, Tunisian artists Hamzaoui Med Amine and Kafon released their new song 'Houmani'.
With over 3.4 million views so far on YouTube the song has become an anthem for young Tunisians.
The video clip, which cost only 250 dinars (about US$150), depicts the residents of a disadvantaged neighborhood as they move through their daily lives.
In the Tunisian dialect the adjective Houmani derives from the noun Houma, which could be translated as a 'working class district'.
Houmani refers to someone living in a working-class area.
A working-class area in Tunisia is called Houma...
And rap speaks of these poor-class neighborhoods that officials and celebrities rarely talk about.
An alien listening to the Houmani.
In the song Hamzaoui and Kafon describe what life is like for young people living in working-class neighborhoods in Tunisia.
The lyrics of the song say:
We're living like garbage in a garbage can. It's suffocating here.
Blogger Mehdi Lamloum explains how Houmani has been successful:
Houmani, a simple song with a strange title and a low-cost video clip has created huge debates in recent weeks...
That's the interesting thing about this play.
She quickly entered popular culture generating conversations and discussions on many topics...
The issue of popular neighborhoods versus affluent neighborhoods even when not directly addressed in the song is very present.
One question that arises for this purpose is... who has the right to listen to Houmani?
Do the inhabitants of "rich neighborhoods" have the right to identify with the everyday life that Houmani relates?
He adds:
Those who criticize the song from a musical point of view are perfectly right.
But they should see what lies beyond the piece: a work that has succeeded in transcribing what Tunisians feel come or not from popular neighborhoods, live or not the everyday life described...
Michelle Bachelet wins the Chilean election but goes to the second round
Michelle Bachelet voting on 17 November 2013 in Santiago, Chile.
Chilean press photo3, rights Demotix
With 46.7% of the vote, former Chilean president Michelle Bachelet was the clear winner of Chile's presidential election, however, the former UN Women executive director will have to go to the second round in December facing conservative candidate Evelyn Matthei, who came in second with 25% of the vote.
Bachelet's victory was no surprise, even some polls had projected that he could achieve an absolute majority in the first round.
But on social media, during the campaign users have expressed their dissatisfaction with Bachelet's candidacy and his previous administration.
After yesterday's results, many are commenting on the difference between the views of social media and the reality in Chile:

Thousands of young people are without scholarships in the Dominican Republic
The Technological Institute of the Americas (ITLA) and the Dominican Telecommunications Institute (INDOTEL) signed a cooperation agreement in 2011, called the Fund for Academic Excellence aimed at outstanding high school and public school students, which aims to graduate hundreds of students in a two-year period to meet the labor demand of the telecommunications industry nationwide.
This is in parallel with statements by the President of the Republic, Danilo Medina, who says that education is the basis for development.
The situation is similar to what happened to Erasmus students in Spain.
Despite the news that the deal was dissolved being circulated, on September 5 of this year, the beneficiaries of the program received an email from the ITLA administration announcing the following:
With regard to students currently holding the scholarship from the Fund for Academic Excellence, INDOTEL has decided to initiate a "rigorous evaluation" of their cases to determine which students are eligible to continue to receive the scholarship.
13009068 received on 5 September in the afternoon, INDOTEL terminates the scholarship project called the Fund for Academic Excellence.
In response to this situation, the Blue Youth movement has emerged, which defines itself as: a group of young people determined to fight for injustices committed in the education system.
Its purpose is to be heard and with unity and effort to obtain the patronage of various institutions and personalities to provide full scholarships to students with limited resources from all over the country.
His supporters have expressed their disagreement with the decision on social media:
There are dreams and entrepreneurial people to make things better but they come and take away our O.o. scholarship #JuventudAzul  Cristy Taveras (@CristyGab8) November 15, 2013

We need education, not posters. #JuventudAzul  O H! (@SrJavierRamos) November 16, 2013

#ITLA wants to give free public technology education.
We need a budget. #BecasITLA for all the youth #JuventudAzul  Jose Armando Tavarez (@jtavarezr) November 13, 2013
However, INDOTEL says that a budget cut of almost 50% is one of the main reasons for this measure, along with some discouraging statistics regarding the effectiveness of the programme, such as: Of the 2,163 students at that institution, 1,062 (47%) defected or lost the benefit of the scholarship because they did not maintain the required rates.
47% of those enrolled are currently overloaded in the scheduled time for graduation, however, the benefits of the program are maintained.

17 pieces of Nelson Mandela's wisdom that we all should read
Nelson Mandela was the first democratically elected president in South Africa.
Photo published by South Africa The Good News under Creative Commons license (CC BY 2.0).
Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically elected president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, died on 5 December 2013 at the age of 95.
Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his struggle against South Africa's system of racial segregation known as apartheid. He was released from prison in 1990, and became president four years later, and left office after only serving for a period, a rare gesture in African politics.
One of his most famous phrases comes from a defiant speech he made in court during his Rivonia betrayal trial in 1964, where he said:
I've fought white domination and I've fought black domination.
I have treasured the ideal of a democratic and free society where all people live together in harmony with equal opportunity.
It's an ideal I hope to live for and achieve.
But if necessary, it's an ideal for which I'm prepared to die.
In addition to his speech at the Rivonia trial, Mandela leaves behind many memorable and wise phrases he said throughout his life.
On judgments
Don't judge me by my successes, judge me by how many times I fell and got up again. - Nelson Mandela
I'm not a saint unless you consider a sinner a saint who keeps trying. - Nelson Mandela
About hate
Hate clouds the mind.
Leaders cannot afford to hate.
If you can learn to hate, you can learn to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than the opposite.
Nobody is born hating Nelson Mandela.
About forgiveness
You will achieve more in this world through acts of kindness than through acts of retaliation.
About the sport
Sport can awaken hope where before there was only hopelessness.
On leadership
Drive from behind and let others think they're ahead.
On racism
I hate racism because I consider it a barbarism, whether it comes from a black man or a white man.
On the determination
It always seems impossible until it's done.
The brave man is not the one who is not afraid, but the one who conquers that fear. - Nelson Mandela, Long March to Freedom, 1994.
Honor belongs to those who never leave the truth, even when things seem dark and gloomy. - Nelson Mandela 1969.
About freedom
Because being free is not just throwing away chains, but living in a way that respects and encourages the freedom of others.
On education
Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.
About the prison
It's said that no one really knows a nation until they're inside its prisons.
On duty
When a man has done what he considers his duty to his people and his country, he can rest in peace. ~ Nelson Mandela.
Iceland mourns first case of man killed by police
Police in Reikiavik, Iceland.

This article and radio report by Traci Tong for The World originally appeared on PRI.org on December 3, 2013 and is republished as part of a content sharing agreement.
This week there has been an unprecedented headline in Iceland: a man died from police fire.
"The country is in shock.
This does not happen in our country", said Thóra Arnórsdóttir, news editor of RUV, the national Icelandic radio and television channel.
The man, who started shooting at the police when they entered the building where he lived, had a history of mental problems.
It's the first time anyone has been killed by armed police in Iceland since it became an independent republic in 1944.
The police don't even usually carry guns.
Violent crimes are almost nonexistent in the country.
"The country does not want its police force to carry weapons because it is dangerous, it is threatening", Arnórsdóttir says.
Weapons are used to hunt as a sport, but we never see weapons".
In fact, Iceland is not anti-gun. In terms of gun ownership per capita, Iceland ranks 15th on the world list. Still, this incident is so rare that the neighbors of the slain man compared the shooting to a scene from an American movie.
The Icelandic police department said the police involved will receive psychological support and has already apologized to the family of the deceased  although not because they did anything wrong.
"It's respectful", says Arnórsdóttir, "because nobody likes to take someone else's life".
There are still many questions to be answered, including why the police did not try to negotiate with the man before entering the building.
"One of the great things about living in this country is that you can enter parliament and all they ask you to do is turn off your mobile phone so you don't disturb parliamentarians while they're talking.
There are no armed guards following the Prime Minister or the President.
We don't want that to change".
Peruvian tweets remember a song dedicated to Mandela
Following the release of the recently deceased South African statesman Nelson Mandela, in the 1990s, the Hispanic-Peruvian musician Miki Gonzáles composed the song "They Released Mandela".

Uruguay became a "whale and dolphin sanctuary"
Photo shared by @PaipoUruguay on Twitter.
Uruguay passed in September the law 19.128, which declares the Uruguay's jurisdictional waters "Whale and Dolphin Sanctuary".
The law applies to the territorial sea and the Uruguay exclusive economic zone, and prohibits hunting, pursuit, appropriation, fishing or the subjecting of any cetacean to transformation processes.
It also prohibits the transport and landing of live whales or dolphins, both on national and foreign flag vessels.
The law provides for penalties for those who do not comply.
Cases of health or scientific interest, as endorsed by national authorities, shall be considered as exceptions.
The law also provides for cases of harassment, aggression or harassment that could lead to the death of the cetaceans.
The law was unanimously approved by the Legislative Power and was promulgated on September 13 by President José Mujica.
The law 19.128 would reinforce existing conservationist policies, carried out by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MGAP) and the National Directorate of Water Resources (DINARA).
DINARA Director Daniel Gilardoni told the Presidency: For our country the biggest threat is navigation, much of the landings are due to the collisions of the boats with cetaceans
Declaring the Uruguayan waters a sanctuary for whales and dolphins would be economically beneficial, according to the article "Uruguay a sanctuary for whales and dolphins: Let the cetaceans come to me" in the blog Ballenas in Uruguay.
Popular opinion was favorable to the enactment of the law.
The social media have been full of positive comments about Uruguay's transformation into a "Whale and Dolphin Sanctuary".
Last year, user Jana (@Piper_uy) contributed to the campaign promoting the law from Twitter:
Ecuador: Authorities raided the house of legislative adviser Fernando Villavicencio
At the request of the Attorney General of the State of Ecuador, Galo Chiriboga, in the evening hours of December 26, 2013, members of the Intervention and Rescue Group (GIR) raided the home of Fernando Villavicencio, advisor to the assemblyman of the Ecuadorian province of Zamora Zhinchipe.
Villavicencio is one of the advisors of assemblyman Cléver Jiménez, member of the Pachakutik party (PK).
Together with activist Carlos Figueroa, they were sentenced to 18 months in prison in early 2013 for the crime of insulting Ecuadorian president Rafael Correa.
In 2011, the three accused the president of allegedly ordering the armed raid on the Police Hospital, during the September 30, 2010 uprising.
The operation in Villavicencio's home, carried out by judicial order of the judge of the National Court Jorge Blum, lasted until 3:00 a.m.
The prosecutor's office was looking for information contained in Villaviencio's computer, memory devices and personal cellphones, which were confiscated in the course of an investigation into alleged espionage of information about government officials' emails.
Within the investigation is also assemblyman Clever Jiménez, his office within the Assembly was also raided.
Jiménez had publicly admitted to possessing several emails from President Rafael Correa and Vice President Jorge Glas, related to the Chevron case.
After the incident, there were many reactions on social media, including Guayaquil's citizen initiative Alfredo Velazco (@alfredovelazco), who tweeted and wrote on Facebook about the contradictions of a double discourse about what is happening in the country:
11.- All this constitutes another abuse of the State, which will be covered up with an infamous campaign against Villavicencio in public media and chains.  Carlos Andrés Vera (@Polificcion) December 27, 2013
Diana Amores Moreno (@Diana_Amores) is ironic about the Secretariat of National Communication (SECOM) about the break-in at Villavicencio's home:
"Chat" is a dirty word in Iran?
WeChat blocked
Internet providers blocked access to WeChat according to reports on various news sites and blogs.
WeChat is an app that allows you to connect with social networks.
Although Iran's own president and a couple of his ministers personally use different social media platforms to communicate with their followers, Iranians are prohibited from accessing sites like Facebook.
Iran Vatan Dust tweeted about the news:
Next thing you know, they're gonna try to filter people's thoughts.
Faar Ranak tweeted:
It doesn't matter if you use WeChat or not.
The main problem is they're leaking it.
The Iranian blogger Gilboygreen writes:
Why did the Islamic Republic of Iran block WeChat?
Because they're afraid people will talk to each other.
Today, it may have appeared symbolizing dialogue.
Why is it that people are not allowed to talk to each other?
The authorities should answer that question.
When a channel for dialogue, exchange of ideas and communication is blocked, how do they intend people to solve the problems of society through dialogue?...
Don't be afraid of the word "chat".
Conversation is a simple human act, accepted in different societies.
Another blogger, 1ironi, comments:
Under unwritten law, any product - including food - that comes to Iran for the first time from abroad is prohibited...
There are several examples of such products that became targets, such as eating tomatoes, watching TV.
Several lawmakers have increased pressure to block WeChat, but we can still use it via psiphon.
Iran-man-massoud blogged ironically pointing to Iran's new president:
#GVMeetup: Global Voices in real life

With drums and dances, the "Carnival of the Country" began in Gualeguaychú
Carnival festivities are coming and the devil is at a party.
In many cities, the pre-carnival celebrations begin with great anticipation.
In Argentina the most popular carnival is held in the city of Gualeguaychú, in the province of Entre Ríos, just 230 km from the city of Buenos Aires.
It's called "The Carnival of the Country".
In Notes from a Private Journey, Cheryl tells us about her last visit:
... to the beat of drums, joy and colors is carried out the last weekend of the "Carnival of the Country", the most important in Argentina in Gualeguaychu, Entre Ríos.
It's a contagious party, surprising with its impressive allegorical carts, sculptural bodies and endless smiles, people don't stop dancing and celebrating.
Argentina during the years of military dictatorship had its carnivals banned, but in cities with long tradition the carnival never ceased to be celebrated.
Gualeguaychú year after year does not cease to surprise with its carnival joy.
On January 4th, the 2014 Carnival began, and during every Saturday until the first days of March thousands of tourists will come to revive a new edition.
The blog El Vestidito Negro publishes photos from 2012, such as these:

Revolution Media is ahead of us, with a video, of everything that will happen in 2014.
Also, Gabo around the world shows us a selection of images as well as tips on how to get there and where to stay.
During the carnival days, the city holds other activities that bring together many people to enjoy its beaches on the Uruguay River.
Amelia McGoldrick's photography blog publishes a selection of images, not only of the carnival but of her days as a tourist in the city.
However, the carnival also brings with it complaints from its neighbors about the uncontrol between the attendees.
The streets were the center of fun and free will for about 90,000 people who filled the city.
There was literally no more soul and yet more and more vehicles were coming in.
But when we say free will, we don't do it just because we use a term that sounds loud, but it was the feeling that many neighbors had that they preferred to almost lock themselves in their homes or, those who were a little more lucky, to move momentarily from the tourist neighborhoods to be more quiet in other parts of the city.
But the party has already begun and the comps, drums, dancing, brilliance are being prepared and tourists are coming to revive once again The Carnival of the Country.
Hong Kong: Incredible question in primary school entrance exam

The Feasts of Calle San Sebastián: The Carnival of Puerto Rico
San Sebastian Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the city of San Juan.
The Feasts originally began as a celebration in honor of Saint Sebastian, born in Narbona, France, and who during the third century of the Common Era was martyred for not renouncing the Christian faith.
In Catholic imagery it is common to depict him pierced by several arrows and tied to a tree.
In the 1950s the tradition of celebrating the festivities in honor of San Sebastián began as a way to raise funds for the repair of some buildings related to the church of San José in the Old San Juan.
This is how the festivities that are still celebrated today, this year in its 44th edition, are born.
Today, the festivities have lost much of their religious character, becoming more of a folk festival that attracts more than 300,000 people annually.
Below are some photos I took during my visit to the festivities.
This is the Calle del Cristo, where many people went up to the Calle San Sebastián.

Shall we start with the good news?
Photographed by Matthew Perkins on Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0)
Here's the good news: Over the years, Global Voices has brought you countless stories about hope, courage and human creativity from around the world.
Here's the bad news: Like other news sites, we're often guilty of focusing more on negative content and maybe we end up depressing you.
Do you normally have a positive expectation of reading Global Voices, or are you discouraged by being exposed to what would seem like an endless array of stories about injustice and human suffering?
In 2014, we plan to focus more on solution-oriented journalism.
So we hope to show more light to humanity than darkness and desolation.
This does not mean that we will ignore bad things, such as violence and poverty.
However, we want to set aside a space to showcase the positive developments.
In fact, we've already started doing it, by sharing stories like good news from Yemen that you didn't know about; or the news of millions of children in Bangladesh getting free textbooks; or how in Angola the internet is being used to preserve native languages.
Many of our stories focus on online social movements and citizens mobilizing to improve their societies.
We want to tell these stories in a way that inspires hope; we want to avoid falling into the same format as traditional media that focuses on the negative.
To begin with, we have created the "Good News" category on Global Voices.
In late December, we organized a GV Face conversation between GV Co-Founder Ethan Zuckerman, Vice Editor Sahar H. Ghazi, Advocacy Editor Ellery Biddle and a server, to discuss the topic of a positive approach to stories in GV.
This will be a long-term effort that will gradually change the way we tell stories together with our authors and editors. We are following the example of many other journalistic sites and organizations that are pioneering in reporting with positive headlines, projecting solution-oriented journalism, conducting constructive reporting and other similar resources.
Even the Huffington Post already has a Good News section (although you'll probably find more cute pet stories there than on Global Voices).
The world we want you to know through Global Voices is beautiful.
It's inhabited by brave, creative individuals who believe the planet can be a better place.
Perhaps through this change we can give our readers a sense of how they can contribute too.
Take a look at the Good News section and share with us what you would like to see on Global Voices.
What's going on in South Sudan?
Rachel Hamada asks, "What's going on in South Sudan?"
A lot of blood has been spilled all over South Sudan in the last few weeks, but there has still been no ink spilled on Addis Ababa.
Talks between the intermediaries and the authorities in South Sudan are still ongoing, and they have moved around the city, although discussions have not reached any concrete resolution, only a supposed agreement without signatures.
He also discusses why the voices of South Sudanese journalists are not being heard:
Meanwhile, it's important to see WHY the voices of South Sudanese journalists are not heard outside.
Imagine you're a journalist from South Sudan.
Foreign journalists have expenses, transportation, good equipment, and local journalists often do not have access to all these resources.
Iran: Facebook administrator arrested

To eat the noodles on the 29th!
You guys.
Photo by Simenon on Flickr, under Creative Commons license (CC BY-SA 2.0) In Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay it is a popular tradition to eat gnocchi on the 29th of each month.
It is not known for certain where or how this custom comes from, but many bloggers have devoted their space and recipes to why and how to do it.
The blog section of Why goes back to the 8th century:
The tradition of serving gnocchi on the 29th day is born from a legend that dates back to the 8th century.
At that time in Nicosia (Greater Asia) lived a young doctor named Pantaleon, who, after converting to Christianity, made a pilgrimage to northern Italy.
There he performed miraculous healings for which he was canonized.
On one occasion he asked some peasants for bread, and they invited him to share their poor table.
Thankfully, he announces a year of excellent fishing and harvesting.
The prophecy was fulfilled and many other miracles.
San Pantaleon was consecrated - along with San Marco - patron saint of Venice.
That episode was on the 29th, so that's why we remember that day with a simple meal represented by the Nooki.
The ritual of putting money under the plate symbolizes the desire for new gifts.
Carambolatango has its favorite story:
During the European War, in Italy, food was scarce then.
The government distributed bonds that were exchanged for food on expenses.
The larger families found themselves in serious difficulty in feeding and reaching the end of the month.
Solidarity between the people was born and the neighbors invited the larger families to eat noquis, which was always considered food for the poor.
They put a bonus under each plate and this gift allowed these groups to trade them for food and get to the end of the month -
In turn, Chocolate and Rambus Moglia Alejandra adds another version of the story:
Another story tells that about 1690, in a village in Piedmont, the wheat harvest was lost.
While potatoes were used only to feed animals, they were so miserable that they cooked them, mixed them with flour, and gave rise to the nooki.
Nuria Eme of Recipes Book publishes a recipe for how to make them and adds:
They usually eat on the 29th of each month, and apparently the origin (of this version, because there are several) is that because it was one of the last days of the month, people who had few resources and were charging the first of the month, had to engineer them to eat with food made from cheap raw materials.
And of course, we already know that potatoes and flour are not overly expensive.
And although the tradition is ancient, I think it is unfortunately extrapolating in time, and totally current with the circumstances we have had to live in.
But tradition went beyond meals.
In Argentina, public employees and those employees who do not work but are paid their salary on the 29th of each month are nicknamed "ñoquis".
Legend or tradition, in the Southern Cone is a custom that is still alive, and if you still can't make them we leave you another recipe:
Berlin and Tokyo celebrate 20 years of friendship as sister cities, and representatives of creative industries, including Marc Wohlrabe, chairman of the Berlin Club Commission, and Takahiro Saito, lawyer and member of Let's Dance, a consortium that fights Japan's dance regulations, will meet after the conference AFTER 25 on March 1, 2014 in Tokyo to discuss how creative culture can contribute to the socio-economic development of both cities:
After the fall of the Berlin Wall, extreme social, cultural and economic changes transformed the city into a unique playground.
Today, 25 years later, it attracts creatives, tech companies, social entrepreneurs and investors from around the world.
Berlin recognized its creative subcultures as part of its identity and history, which now act as key drivers for tourism and the economy.
This transformed Berlin into a unique, successful city, demonstrated how support for creativity can grow to be key economic and social factors that fuel innovation and growth.
This dramatic and positive change that has taken place in Berlin leads us to the question: What role can Tokyo's creative culture play in laying the foundations for the next phase of the city?

El Salvador and Costa Rica will have a second round of elections
El Salvador and Costa Rica held presidential elections on Sunday, February 2, but both countries will define their president in a second round of elections.
In El Salvador, "results show that Salvador Sánchez Ceren (FMLN) got 49%, just under 50% that he needed to win in the first round.
Norman Quijano (ARENA) is in second place with 39%", writes Boz of Bloggings by boz, where he publishes" Five Points in El Salvador's elections ".
Meanwhile in Costa Rica, The Tico Times reports:
The center-left presidential candidate Luis Guillermo Solís will contest the ruling party's candidate, Johnny Araya, in a second round on April 6, after Solís astonished many in this small Central American country by reaching first in the preliminary results given to public on Sunday night.
The peaceful elections in Costa Rica showed a growing polarization between progressive and conservative voters.
Mental health of children
The Indigenous News website analyzes a study by BMC Psychiatry on 748 children aged 9 and 15 from nine different schools attending students from low socioeconomic sectors in the northern Chilean city of Arica.
Aymara families are traditionally developed, where the elders advise the young and it is customary for the mother to take care of the household chores and be responsible for the education of the children, while the father is the one who makes the decisions and provides the economic support of the family.
Increased participation in Aymara culture can be a protective factor against anxiety and symptoms of depression in Aymara children.
This points to an additional benefit to the preservation of cultural traditions within this population.

After a grenade explosion killed three children at an anti-government protest in Bangkok, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) urged the government and protest leaders to protect the children and keep them away from them.
Bijaya Rajbhandari, UNICEF's representative in Thailand, made this call:
(UNICEF) condemns the violence resulting from these tragic and senseless accidents and deaths of children.
These incidents highlight the urgent need to keep children out of harm's way in order to ensure their safety.
UNICEF urges the Government, the leaders of the protests, whether pro- or anti-government, and all parents to ensure that their children do not enter the protest sites and keep them away from all areas where they are held.
In Cuba, as everywhere else, everything but wages increase
Food prices have risen in Cuba in recent times, while the wages of state workers remain the same. (Photo courtesy of the author)
The recently concluded congress of the Central of Workers of Cuba, the only organization of its kind in the country, concluded with the confirmation that there will be no increase in wages for state workers in Cuba until productivity increases.
In this country, the average wage of state workers amounts to 15 dollars a month (according to the exchange rate of the official Cuban currency) and living costs have increased over the past years, following the implementation of economic measures such as the elimination of some basic food from the basket subsidized by the State.
This is in addition to the significant increase in food prices on the non-State market.
According to Cuban President Raul Castro,
It would be irresponsible and counterproductive to have a widespread increase in wages in the public sector, since the only thing that would cause it would be an inflationary spiral in prices, if it is not duly supported by a sufficient increase in the supply of goods and services.
The conditioning of wage increases to productivity increases brings the debate on the subject in Cuba back to the vicious circle in which it has been in recent times.
In this regard, the newly elected secretary of the organization, Ulises Guilarte, noted that in not a few places this is noted as:
... cause of dismotivation, apathy and disinterest in work, with the consequent impacts on labour discipline, the exodus of skilled workers to better paid but less demanding activities from the professional point of view, undoubtedly resulting in a process of decapitalisation of the workforce, which has mainly impacted the basic industrial branches, the Ministry of Construction and others, in addition to the increasingly frequent refusal to be promoted to management responsibilities.
In his speech, Raúl Castro confirmed that medical services will receive a salary increase, "because the country's basic income at this time obeys the work of thousands of doctors providing services abroad".
In January 2011, the Brazilian ambassador to Havana announced that this year there will be 11,000 Cuban doctors in his country working in the poorest and hardest-to-reach areas.
This South-South cooperation is endorsed by the Pan American Health Organization and will provide about $500 million dollars annually to Cuba.
From his blog, Esquinas de Cuba, Alejandro Ulloa says that:
If we do not achieve abundant foreign investment, as well as recapitalization of important productive sectors, the Cuban economy will be moving in this vicious circle, which is all the more concerned about the increase in the purchasing power of wages, a real problem affecting the population today.
Protests against a television program in Iran
Sarzamine Kohan
Protests against the television series called Sarzamine Kohan (Old Land) erupted in mid-February in several cities in Iran, including Dezful and Ahvaz in the oil-rich province of Juzestan.
Protesters say the program insulted the Bajjitarian ethnic group and the role the leaders played in the Iranian Constitutional Revolution.
In at least one dialogue of the fiction show, it was said that the Bakhtyaris are "at the service of the English", meaning they were traitors.
Sixty members of parliament wrote a letter of resignation to Iranian state television complaining about this representation.
The Bajtiari ethnic group, which lives mainly in Chahar Mahal, Bajtiari and certain areas of Juzestan, Loreestan and Isfahan provinces, played an important role in the history of Iran.
Protests in Dezful
Freedom Messenger shared several footage of a demonstration in Dezful, which took place on Friday 14.
Several internet users tweeted about the controversial series.
Tevis tweeted:
Today, they will destroy Bajjtiari, tomorrow they will destroy other ethnic groups.
The_Sina tweeted:
Here are the photographs of the demonstration in Masjed Soleiman that took place on Friday, February 15.
If you protest, do it in a good way, without violence.
Iran's third channel (which airs the controversial series) played bajtiari music several times today.
Probably to dampen the current atmosphere.
I then exist: messages in local languages
A few days ago, I was chatting with a good friend of mine on the BlackBerry messaging platform.
We were talking about specialized topics, and we were doing it in Nigerian pidgin.
I'm not a Nigerian, but living with a large community of Nigerians teaches.
While we were talking I was frustrated because my phone's self-correction function insisted on correcting the interjection  na  to  N'a , or it completed the expression  sha  as  shame .
So I impulsively opened the language settings, and when he asked me to choose a language, I laughed, because I realized the pointlessness: pidgin is not on the list of languages of any modern electronic platform.
Screenshot of  Yoruba Keyboard , an application that replaces the keyboard to be able to write in Yoruba, a language available in the Windows Phone OS.
Photo from Nuges Apps licensed under CC BY 2.0.
So I thought about it and I asked myself why?
According to user data from the Nigerian Communications Commission, Nigeria has about 122 million connected and active telephone lines, of which 97% are mobile lines, making the country the first in this category in Africa and ninth in the world.
Still, the most common language in Nigeria is not available in phone settings.
However, this problem is not unique to Nigeria.
Around the world, dialects and vehicular languages (lingua franca) less widespread than official languages are underrepresented in the technological world.
For example, Urdu is the national and vehicle language of Pakistan, and is the official language in five Indian states.
In Africa, however, several dialects of the Bantu family, with similar prevalence, are not present on mobile devices.
There are third-party apps and plugins to help native speakers feel more comfortable with their smartphones.
Among those projects, Kannada-Hindi Keyboard allows its users to type from messages to notes in Kannada and Devanagari (Marathi/Hindi) script from India, and Multiling Keyboard is a keyboard application for Android that accepts around 130 languages.
But the developers of these applications often suffer from a lack of funding and lack of consumer support, which often leads to them abandoning the project.
Or does the world think that these languages have no place in the advanced technology sector?
Hopefully, in the years ahead, we will have Android or iOS platforms that allow us to customize the root user interface, including keyboard and data input settings in Pashtun and Igbo languages.
Flipboard adds Global Voices to Local Content Guides
Italian Flipboard users will find Global Voices prominently mentioned in the recommended news section.

Chile: 'The March of all marches' takes place in Santiago
March of all marches, Santiago de Chile.
Image from @SorayaSM
With the slogan The march of all causes united , more than 40 civil organizations (except students) convened this Saturday 22 to the 'March of all marches' that gathered more than a hundred thousand people in Santiago to claim a new constitution via a constituent assembly.
This event was convened from the need to unite civil society, to make the request to the government of Michelle Bachelet to change the current Political Constitution of Chile, which was promulgated during Pinochet's military dictatorship.

Another of the petitions is a universal law of rights.
David Ordenes, coordinator of Movement Movilizando Nos, told Global Voices that they are demanding a universal law of rights focused more on children and youth: "so that this society from now on complies with children, because they are democracy and social actors... and therefore the march of all marches has to do with the fact that we are attentive and making proposals".
The massive protest unfolded peacefully until the end of the tour, where clashes with the Carabineros took place.

FOTOS: Watching birds in the southern Philippines
It's black.
This is Arnold Alamon.
There are over 600 species of birds on the 7,000 islands that make up the Philippines, which means there are plenty of opportunities to observe the elegant beauty of these flying creatures.
Unfortunately, bird habitats are threatened by the aggression of real estate projects and the rapid destruction of the natural environment.
In recent years, bird watching has become more than just an organized and fun activity for amateurs and scientists across the country.
One of the festival's organizers, maiabird, wrote something about the strange bird species found in Zamboanga:
So I got three shots in four hours of observation in Pasonanca.
The Pasonanca Natural Park is a wonderful place to go birdwatching.
The place itself is amazing, and so is the life of the birds (and even tracking them is easy!).
We'll definitely be back and spend more time discovering more of the forest.
Of course, we automatically dumped the contents of our garbage bags near the nests of the dawn shepherds, and that made the pond an important place for birds.

Wikitongues: document your language
Screenshot of wikitongues.org (11-03-14)
Wikitongues is a new project that aims to document the 7,000 languages on the planet.
Currently, Wikitongues is building a platform where anyone can upload their own videos, making it a collaborative project as well as a non-profit initiative.
Developers expect to have doubled the number of videos currently (50) by the end of the year.
The volunteers who help to draw up this database to facilitate access to information are called 'ambassadors', located in Switzerland, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Norway, Russia and Spain.
According to co-founder Daniel Bogre Udell, by documenting many different people from different regions speaking the same language, they hope to obtain a cultural application of the language.
Here's an example in English, with one speaker from North Carolina, USA, and another from South Africa:
Here's a section for polyglot people, people who speak more than one language: The videos include what are commonly known as "minority languages", such as Quiché, a derivative of Maya, which originated in Guatemala.
However, the Wikitongues team is cautious not to refer to the different languages as majority or minority on the website, and they give everyone an equal number regardless of the total number of speakers in the world.
Wikitongues also chooses a "Language of the Week" to discuss on their Tumblr blog, and includes links and information about each language.
Until recently, they focused on Basque.
You can follow the project on Instagram and Twitter, and connect to share your own videos.
